The latest album, Ready Coat came into existence after the decision to add a touring member enabled the band to expand its sonic ability. This opportunity to stretch the bands sound and add elements which would have previously been impossible to play live, enabled them to self-produce, engineer, and mix a record without considering limitations. There are absolutely no words to express the bandʼs anticipation and excitement for finally being able to play these new songs (as well as many, many others) live on tour.
