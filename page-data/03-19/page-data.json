Canadian musician Jeff Hartford’s enthusiasm for music began at a young age, he grew up playing in bands and learning instruments like piano, trumpet, and guitar. His immersion in songwriting continued to grow when he attended university, and he interned for a composer after completing his courses. It was during this time that he started applying the techniques he’d learned in the studio to electronic music and began sending his completed works to deadmau5’s mau5trap label. The label initially signed a few tracks and then ATTLAS as an artist, and Hartford released three EPs in 2015 via the Canadian imprint. In the years since then, he’s delivered singles, EPs, and remixes – all showcasing the textured, introspective sound he’s spent years cultivating. 2019 brought exciting new developments to the ATTLAS journey, including a new installment of his lauded Storyline series and a debut album. The album “synthesized all the experiences and wandering paths that ATTLAS walks,” according to Hartford, bringing together heavier sounds and the emotive melodies he’s built his musical brand on. 2020 proved difficult for everyone; Hartford included who was forced to cancel his ‘Lavender God Tour’, named for his debut album. Rather than focusing on the missed opportunities, Jeff has taken this year to dive even deeper into his musical craft. After a few one off releases and several remixes, including a captivating melodic single “The Night Air Was Cool”, Jeff released his second album at the top of November. The latest album, titled ‘Out Here With You’, encompasses the shift in the music industry and the way we’re digesting music without live touring. Rawer and more intimate than ever before, ‘Out Here With You’ is Jeff’s way of showing his fans and the world that we were not alone during this troubling time and that we’re all trying to navigate the state of the current world together. 2021 brought new heights to Jeff’s career, most notably a Juno nomination for Best Electronic album for his inaugural ‘Lavender God’. iding off the high of this great honor, Jeff has gotten back on the road touring and is excited to drop his 3rd album later this year on Mau5trap. Be sure to keep an eye on this one, for this is just the beginning for ATTLAS.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-19-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/attlas"},"data":{"Name":"ATTLAS"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/af51c9c1224f606cea961cf2d9fbf679/13a79bfb/55e1ad47-0b46-f580-cd51-405a706b162a"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"03-19-2022","today":"2022-02-11T06:12:11.507Z","slug":"03-19"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
