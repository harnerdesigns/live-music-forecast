If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability.\n\nHead for the Hills--Adam Kinghorn, Joe Lessard, Matt Loewen--come out swinging and invigorated with fresh sounds on their latest EP, Say Your Mind. Recorded at Swingfingers Studios in Fort Collins (Colorado), the band brought a larger band than ever before, including drummer Darren Garvey of Elephant Revival, Vocalist Kim Dawson, Dobroist Todd Livingston, a horn section and more. The material reflects both the turbulent social rhythms of our current era and more timeless moments of joy, growth, and change.\n\nLike a painter that starts in acrylic and graduates to oils, Head for the Hills is deeper and richer in their 15th year as a band, with a wider palette of sonic textures at their disposal.  Dorm room jam sessions have turned into a decade plus on the road--from humble coffee shops to theaters, festivals, roadhouses and clubs all across the country. Over time those sounds and influences have crept more and more into the bluegrass beginnings of the band, morphing into the seasoned eclecticism of Say Your Mind. The new songs are quinnessential Head for the Hills; genre-stradling, lyrically deep, and danceable, with a crew of collaborators bringing the best of Colorado acoustic, roots, and soul music together. \n\nHead for the Hills numerous festival appearances include notables Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, South by Southwest, FloydFest, RockyGrass, DelFest, Summer Camp Music Festival, WinterWonderGrass Festival, Blue Ox Music Festival, Northwest String Summit, Strawberry Music Festival, Chicago Bluegrass & Blues Festival, Folk Alliance, Grandoozy and many more. The band charted on the CMJ Top 200 twice, has been featured on NPR Ideastream and eTown, and was awarded Best Bluegrass in Colorado four times via Denverâ€™s Westword Magazine. \n\n<H3> The Cody Sisters </H3> \n\nThe Cody Sisters Band is the very heart of contemporary acoustic music in Colorado, the United States, and the UK. Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, mandolin, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-18-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/head-for-the-hills"},"data":{"Name":"Head for the Hills"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f4f7826330128d64d129351b04e2f461/b6b7ad96/aff4c6d0-622e-53e1-1722-e812c906b241"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/guerra-de-sonoras-noche-de-cumbia-aniversario-grupo-kaoba-2022-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T03:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Guerra de sonoras, noche de cumbia, Aniversario grupo kaoba 2022","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-18-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cf048a403099ae415e2ee09151386ee3/fdce6d42/19_Edp.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Aurora"],"Venue_Name":["Stampede"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/stampede"},"data":{"City":"Aurora","Name":"Stampede"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-war-on-drugs-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The War On Drugs","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-18-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Indie Rock"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/the-war-on-drugs"},"data":{"Name":"The War On Drugs"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e3f0adf1d15e3a3757425bf009bd9da7/ad638f77/f4dab1f9-4e30-4b42-8ab5-925869ebb48e_1478561_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/cautious-clay-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Cautious Clay","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-18-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/cautious-clay"},"data":{"Name":"Cautious Clay"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/469f6e865a1176d17bb51e1d1c872b7c/3c3f970f/c979ef44-89cf-4697-bd00-0677560c2dc3_1447561_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Bluebird Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Bluebird Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/valentino-khan-at-temple-denver-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T05:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Valentino Khan at Temple Denver","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-18-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f1e812bc95800d25fe4f177038536a92/28b97e98/9d5f1b95-a2e4-4101-b469-0bc26df71806_422621_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Temple Nightclub"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/temple-nightclub"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Temple Nightclub"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"02-18-2022","today":"2022-02-18T06:12:33.212Z","slug":"02-18"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
