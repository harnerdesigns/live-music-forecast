They began touring as a family band, boarding a 1956 tour bus (once belonging to Bill Monroe, Kitty Wells, and Ernest Tubb) and headed south from Ohio to Tennessee. At age 11, Mayfield began playing guitar and writing songs.At age 15, Mayfield recorded her first album White Lies under the moniker Chittlin, printing only a few hundred copies. One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. After an introduction, Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio, laying the foundation of her debut album With Blasphemy So Heartfelt. Pitchfork Media gave the record a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Online magazine Blurt named the record the Best Album of 2008 and gave Mayfield the title of Best New Artist of 2008.Her latest record, Sorry is Gone was released in 2017 and detailed her years of quietly enduring domestic abuse by her then-husband.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1c6798f0f6db2a64f893fcbc8a13ff18/7fe2a3f5/1cae9108-6a98-4696-9f32-b075d16e90fc_619361_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1657414693&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=c0312e2e35937745"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/show-me-the-body-soul-glo-wifigawd-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Show Me the Body, Soul Glo, Wifigawd","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/16ebcad49e258bfddff5d1bca8d83b9c/c6a7f1ed/453f7656-9a18-406f-8df9-abf159b34c9b_1550801_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657414692&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=fd477e8c2c51f2b0"}],"Venue_City":["Colorado Springs"],"Venue_Name":["Black Sheep"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/black-sheep"},"data":{"City":"Colorado Springs","Name":"Black Sheep"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/cowboy-junkies-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-07-15T01:00:00.000Z","Name":"Cowboy Junkies","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/cowboy-junkies"},"data":{"Name":"Cowboy Junkies"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8ef111bc8cdb6724bcc01499c152fb2d/372b2b2c/20d1c70c-a312-4281-b8fb-5ea4fff74fdb_1449941_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657414693&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=743f6b7e378f0136"}],"Venue_City":["Grand Junction"],"Venue_Name":["Avalon Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/avalon-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Grand Junction","Name":"Avalon Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/we-are-william-dimension-knife-in-hand-when-darkness-falls-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"We Are William, Dimension, Knife In Hand, When Darkness Falls","Description":"Formed in 2017, We Are William is a progressive metal band out of Northern Colorado.

Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4b0a2651b9fb56d1dc79845360afc858/2b7e021e/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657414692&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7c871031c5e37a9c"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Vultures"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/vultures"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Vultures"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/we-are-william-intrinsic-gray-dimensions-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"We Are William, Intrinsic Gray, Dimensions","Description":"Formed in 2017, We Are William is a progressive metal band out of Northern Colorado.
