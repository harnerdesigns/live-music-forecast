Rev. Peyton, the Big Damn Bands vocalist and world-class fingerstyle guitarist, details bleak financial challenges on the songs Ways and Means and Dirty Hustlin. He pines for in-person reunions with loved ones on No Tellin When, and he pleads for celestial relief on the album-closing Come Down Angels.Far from a depressing listen, Dance Songs lives up to its name by delivering action-packed riffs and rhythms across 11 songs. The country blues trio that won over crowds on more than one Warped Tour knows how to make an audience move.I like songs that sound happy but are actually very sad, Peyton says. I dont know why it is, but I just do.Of course, the greatest front-porch blues band in the world found itself sidelined from a relentless touring schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic. Peyton says he was surprised when his mind and soul unleashed a batch of new songs in March and April of 2020.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/017fa79dfe4190af0bac62403cab07a0/de9a8256/32bd8764-1ed9-4881-9067-11c26a515186_880511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657217720&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1a92d1fb2bd4bb6e"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/nick-waterhouse-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-11T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Nick Waterhouse","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/nick-waterhouse"},"data":{"Name":"Nick Waterhouse"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d5fbe4ac588aaff76fac5a3da6818fa6/3a2fea3e/88cd379d-8aa5-4f9f-9c47-047fbe051b1f_1510121_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657217720&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=c8ad3d9732fec266"}],"Venue_City":["Fort Collins"],"Venue_Name":["Armory Event Center"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/armory-event-center"},"data":{"City":"Fort Collins","Name":"Armory Event Center"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/exmortus-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-11T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Exmortus","Description":"Doors 7:00 PM Show 8:00 PM THIS SHOW IS ALL AGES All support acts and times subject to change","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/exmortus"},"data":{"Name":"Exmortus"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cb234356bd934e158c206bdca0b62cfd/83c41324/402c3c5b-6b1b-4864-922b-b9cef5599629_829631_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657217719&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b6404929d93b5d03"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Marquis Theater"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/marquis-theater"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Marquis Theater"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-avett-brothers-w-regina-spektor-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-11T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Avett Brothers w/ Regina Spektor","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/regina-spektor"},"data":{"Name":"Regina Spektor"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ddfdbb339bb46eb94d0f5855276e237d/8a8258d9/13ea9a5b-6484-4123-a0bb-aa5af08ad289_1449931_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657217720&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=52df9dc8e80d9f4a"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Red Rocks Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/tiny-moving-parts-w-this-wild-life-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-11T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Tiny Moving Parts w/ This Wild Life","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/bb41a60d97b1e7bb693168dbd5ac520e/2d04e4ab/ba077c42-c28e-4d49-ac53-a1ab9cf3ceda_1092151_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1657217719&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=981b8ca20261a0a4"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Oriental Theatre-CO"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/oriental-theatre-co"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Oriental Theatre-CO"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"07-10-2022","today":"2022-07-07T18:15:31.469Z","slug":"07-10"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
