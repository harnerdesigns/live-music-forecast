Often referred to as “The Master of Emotion” his music is patently beautiful and melodic.  With diverse influences ranging from trip-hop, classical and Arabic to bass driven compositions, his songs are considered anthemic and timeless.  As a multi-instrumentalist and singer, his tracks are organic, uplifting and stand on their own as a distinct genre.  Listeners of all types of music can find something they can relate to in his sound.  He has toured extensively across North America, including tours with Bassnectar, Shpongle, Emancipator, Beats Antique, and has headlined dozens festivals across the U.S. and internationally. \n\nThere is no doubt that Rab understands a multitude of musical styles.  He has been the front man of a heavy metal band, toured as a classical trumpet player, played bass in a country music band, was a scratch DJ for a jazz fusion project, was the singer for a rock band in Mexico and has collaborated with countless musicians of all styles.  From acoustic performances in the Himalayas to rocking packed clubs in New York, Random Rab has found a way to connect with people of all kinds. \n\nWith a dedicated fanbase born from the San Francisco underground, Random Rab has become known worldwide for his sunrise sets that have now become one of his most sought after performances.  Having played before 3 solar eclipses and at the Pyramids of Giza, Random Rab has created a unique niche for his equally danceable, yet thought-provoking compositions.    His current popularity can often be traced to his breakout album, The Elucidation of Sorrow and in particular his first hit, The Riddle and followed up by hits such as Release, Falling Tao, For My Corpse and Apparently.  His critically acclaimed current and 10th album Formless Edge, catapulted him into the state of momentum that is now taking hold internationally.  \n\n<H3>  Equanimous </H3> \n\nEquanimous is a music producer, DJ, and multi-instrumentalist. He combines elements of downtempo, bass, house, and melodic dance music to create a joyous high vibrational atmosphere on the dance @loor. Equanimous expands the electronic music experience by playing live djembe, keys, and beatboxing along with his tracks. He’s known for his deep bass, beautiful melodies, live looping, and creative rhythmic beats that take people into a state of euphoric dancing and heart-centered bliss.\n\n<H3> Skysia </H3> \n\nForgoing electronic music’s inherent heaviness for a spiritualized serenity and elegant songcraft, Skysia fuses elements of melodic bass, chill-step, and modern downtempo into a euphonious sound. The producer/composer often reveals a minimalist, deliciously danceable style; his translucent low-end theory is rich in musicality and steeped in dreamy psychedelia. Born Tanner Allen, Skysia is a self-taught pianist, filmmaker, and production wizard; formerly based in Southern California, these days he lives in a converted mini-school bus - complete with mobile studio, crafting sound art while perpetually immersed in nature. Skysia mines earthy textures and unveils emotive tones, sonically expressing the delicate balance between darkness and light. His crisp, clear compositions invoke the sacred and sexy, humbly channeled through medicinal bass music. Drawing inspiration from global dancefloor pioneers like Bonobo and CloZee. Before embarking on a musical journey on the West Coast scene, Allen studied production techniques at the esteemed Point Blank Music School in London.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-05-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/random-rab"},"data":{"Name":"Random Rab"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9dfa431e2165d674e5176b87dd53338a/d99c39cb/9623d5a1-9a44-52b6-daec-15d955a8abc9"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/yungblud-03-05-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-06T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Yungblud","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-05-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/yungblud"},"data":{"Name":"YUNGBLUD"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9ba935e95b8832f8358aac0a2094d899/4816db94/4179bcec-e09d-46c8-939d-1d1e4b73a2f3_1539351_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"03-05-2022","today":"2022-03-03T12:19:03.785Z","slug":"03-05"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
