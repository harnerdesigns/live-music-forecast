Its a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012s The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether its a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above. The records essence was shaped by those beautiful desert nights and the roads that go on endlessly, says J.R. A Celebrations cover art with its western color palette, desert iconography, and black-and-white photograph of wild animals was handmade by J.R., who also created a series of accompanying prints.

Members are Aesop Adams on lead guitar and vocals, Aaron Dooley on bass and vocals, Chris Sparks on rhythm guitar, and Dan Somerville on Drums. Their solo efforts hailed by Record Crates United as psychedelic down to its very DNA and the definition of cosmic music respectively, childhood friends Adams and Dooley moved to Denver in 2017, where they met locals Sparks and Somerville. Combining their loves for deep-end psych and emo-hardcore, Totem Pocket creates music that swerves between atmoshpheric tranquility and total sonic warfare. Currently, the band is recording their debut album while playing shows throughout Colorado.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-22-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c7f55ebfb858eac1c3037c67d757118/765357b3/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1658384239&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=43973099553ab291"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/tx-2-07-22-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-23T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"TX2","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-22-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/tx-2"},"data":{"Name":"TX2"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9ccd14ef7985611d727a772971a22c1/1faf01bf/c5c08e7a-9912-456c-a060-2758be94e060_105881_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1658384238&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6eec62b0fc71ab84"}],"Venue_City":["Fort Collins"],"Venue_Name":["Aggie Theater"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/aggie-theater"},"data":{"City":"Fort Collins","Name":"Aggie Theater"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"07-22-2022","today":"2022-07-21T06:17:37.379Z","slug":"07-22"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
