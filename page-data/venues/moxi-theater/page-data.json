Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.

Jones","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Over the course of three full-length albums and two EPs, Jonathon Robert Linaberry has woven his own tapestry of American roots music. Its a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012s The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether its a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above. The records essence was shaped by those beautiful desert nights and the roads that go on endlessly, says J.R. A Celebrations cover art with its western color palette, desert iconography, and black-and-white photograph of wild animals was handmade by J.R., who also created a series of accompanying prints. A Celebration does more than shine a light on the American southwest it highlights J.R.s ability to the bridge the gap between artistic disciplines.Moxi Theater is operating at Full CapacityReserve a Table in Advance Online.All Responsible Ages Permitted*PHOTO ID REQUIRED FOR ENTRYThe Moxi Theater is proudly partnered with Lunas Tacos s is located at 806 9th St. - next door to the Moxi and is open for Dinner, Happy Hour, and Late Night.
