Four good friends that brew a musical alchemy that is song centric with a proclivity to stretch things out and see where the evening leads. Heard across radio waves, through the trees at festivals like Electric Forrest, Firefly, and Telluride Blues this band keeps growing and morphing and wants you in on the ride.Dragondeer has had the pleasure to share the stage with Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, Marcus King, The Revivalists, Shakey Graves, Southern Avenue, Dumpstaphunk, Drive By Truckers, Anders Osbourne, and Jerry JosephDragondeer hit the stage with their thick blues-rock sound. Reminiscent of early Led Zeppelin, The Black Keys, and electric Taj Mahal, the quartet stunned the audience with their hybrid of Mississippi Delta blues and 1960s psychedelic rock. Lead vocalist, guitarist and harmonica player Eric Halborg led the band with a rare ferocity, his deep growl and swampy harmonica blending perfectly with Cole Rudys raw pedal steel playing. Shocking many in attendance and quickly catapulting onto the Denver scene, Dragondeer is a growing force to be reckoned with. - Live For Live MusicMoxi Theater is operating at Full CapacityReserve a Table in Advance Online.All Responsible Ages Permitted*PHOTO ID REQUIRED FOR ENTRYThe Moxi Theater is proudly partnered with Lunas Tacos s is located at 806 9th St. - next door to the Moxi and is open for Dinner, Happy Hour, and Late Night.

BIG DAD RITCH captains this pirate ship of bikers, outlaws, troubadours, and hellraisers, welcoming all comers to the THC party with gregarious charisma and Southern charm. Across a half dozen albums, countless club gigs, and show stealing performances at Rockstar Mayhem, THC has spread the good word of big riffs, big hooks, and wild times. High in the Saddle is a record full of unashamed, full-throttle ass kicking. Its the bands second pairing with producer Bob Marlette (Black Stone Cherry, Rob Zombie) and sixth album over all, on the heels of the No. 2 Billboard Heatseekers slab, Dark Side of Black .

They take their name from the roadway that links their hometown of Lake Jackson, Texas to Galveston, where the cops, the teachers, the baristas and the chemical plant workers travel to work hard and to play hard, blowing off steam, dancing to their favorite bands. Blue Water Highways music is the soundtrack for their lives.Best Friend is the first single from their upcoming album Heartbreak City, coming out on Blue Water Highway Records/Thirty Tigers on June 8th. With a hook thats a mile wide, it chronicles the lives, loves and friendships that sustain us. Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, We wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into that feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another. Even though I wrote characters that are not the band members, our relationship definitely informed the writing of the lyrics.Blue Water Highway was started by two best friends from high school -Kibodeaux (lead vocals, guitar) and Greg Essington (guitar). They were later joined by Catherine Clark (keyboards), Jared Wilson (drums) and Kyle James Smith (bass). They will be touring relentlessly to support Heartbreak City, so look for them in a town near you soon.
