One listen to their&nbsp;</span>forthcoming album, Shadowbox (released on their own Beats Antique Records imprint),&nbsp;and their unique hybrid of sound makes perfect sense; their ability to blend so many&nbsp;different kinds of music in to an incredibly vibrant, distinctive and peerless album is what&nbsp;this band has been doing for the past ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Based in Oakland, California, Sidecar Tommy, David Satori and Zoe Jakes make up&nbsp;</span>Beats Antique, who released their 10th album on October 5th 2016 to commemorate their&nbsp;tenth year as a band. They&rsquo;ve mounted a larger-than-life cross-country tour that will take&nbsp;their vision to theaters across America. &ldquo;Shadowbox is both the title of our new album, the&nbsp;theme of our tour, and our new store front in Berkeley CA. We decided to bring it all&nbsp;together on this release.&ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Mostly recorded at their studio in Oakland (which has been around since the 50s), the&nbsp;</span>Bay Area band also recorded in Russia and Israel. &ldquo;We were lucky to record in both&nbsp;Moscow and Tel Aviv, because we had shows there and wanted to connect with the local&nbsp;artists. We had amazing sessions in both locations; In Moscow we recorded on the&nbsp;outskirts of the city in a wild Industrial complex. We ended up going through strange&nbsp;corridors into this plush bamboo-floored-Hare-Krishna-owned recording studio with state&nbsp;of the art gear. When we were in Tel Aviv, we gave a call to a local legend Yossi Fine and&nbsp;he helped us get time at Pluto Studios, which is one of the best in the city. We recorded&nbsp;with Talya Solan and her amazing group of musicians. We used elements of the Tel Aviv&nbsp;session to create our track &ldquo;Bdna Salam,&rdquo; which is raising money for Syrian refugees.&rdquo;&nbsp;Along with Talya other features on Shadowbox include Lafa Taylor, Alam Khan, Tatiana&nbsp;Kalmykova, brasshouse trio Too Many Zooz (who are touring with Beats Antique),&nbsp;Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dana Elle, Madoline Tasquin and Medium Troy Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox is a retrospective of sorts, with Beats Antique pulling from all of their previous&nbsp;</span>work as almost a homage to the first ten years of their career. &ldquo;This will be our first full&nbsp;album produced in Beats Antique&rsquo;s recording studio/dance performance space. We feel&nbsp;like Shadowbox touches on all our styles from down-temp Middle Eastern influences to&nbsp;cinematic orchestral arrangements. The songwriting process is also different for every&nbsp;song. Sometimes David will come in with a melody and Sidecar will add the bass and&nbsp;beats, and vise versa. One thing that always makes the songwriting process unique is&nbsp;that Zoe creates and arranges music based around stories she wants to tell though&nbsp;dance, so sometimes the performance aspect influences the creation of the music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In June, the group premiered the first single, &ldquo;Killer Bee,&rdquo; featuring Lafa Taylor,&nbsp;</span>on Billboard.com. The track is &ldquo;about standing up to prejudices. Just because someone&nbsp;calls you a killer bee, doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to kill. We want people to define themselves&nbsp;and not be defined by what people think they should be.&rdquo; In addition to being a &lsquo;killer&rsquo;&nbsp;track, with a compelling music video directed by Kyrian Bobeerian, Beats Antique&nbsp;donated a percentage of the proceeds from their July 1st show at Red Rocks&nbsp;Amphitheatre to The Honeybee Conservancy, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness&nbsp;about the importance of bees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>An enthusiastic touring band, a new album also means a new tour, and since Beats&nbsp;</span>Antique is all about the &lsquo;concept,&rsquo; Shadowbox (the album and the idea) is another&nbsp;opportunity for them to get the creative juices flowing for the live shows. The band plan to&nbsp;use shadows, light, Indonesian shadow puppetry, custom-created lanterns, dance, story&nbsp;telling, crowd participation and more to make sure this is an unforgettable visual spectacle&nbsp;for their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox, an album that is an amalgamation of the history of Beats Antique, merged&nbsp;</span>with a tour that will both tease and excite the senses, shows off what this band does best &ndash; transform, innovate and revolutionize what you think you know about music.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["World Fusion","Psychill"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/aee6d0cd852f52fadd396b8a47647958/531612ef/uploadedimage_5df0327046d4e.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/twiddle-11-06-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-07T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Twiddle","Subtitle":"Dopapod","Description":"<p>Vermont-based rock band Twiddle has built an impressive resume spanning Red Rocks to Bonnaroo, and multiple sellouts of historic rock venues including Port Chester, NY&rsquo;s Capitol Theatre, and Washington D.C.&rsquo;s 9:30 Club.

The idea for the melody, inspired by Southern gospel music, came to me driving out of the mountains into Georgia from my home in North Carolina. When we wrote it, I was feeling a deep sense of hope for humanity that the sun will rise again.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Then, there&rsquo;s the hummable instrumental &ldquo;Cloud Valley,&rdquo; which exudes a sci-fi spirit of wonder via sonic intricacy. &ldquo;Science fiction can transport you to a place of deep imagination,&rdquo; says Pandolfi. &ldquo;We wanted to generate a soundscape for an imaginary mystical setting. It really came alive when we all got together.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Everything culminates on a heartfelt send-off with &ldquo;Truth and Love.&rdquo; Its delicate musical backdrop transmits an important statement for The Infamous Stringdusters.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;I wrote that a few years ago and brought it back now, because I feel like the message has become more relevant today,&rdquo; Falco states. &ldquo;The world is polarized.

You start to be comfortable with who you are onstage and off, and that all blends together. I think I finally know who I am as a person.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As the frontman for the band bearing his name, Daughtry has become one of the most visible and consistent rock &amp; roll torchbearers of the 21st Century. Since rising to prominence on the fifth season of American Idol, he has released four albums, all of which reached the Billboard Top Ten and have combined sales over 8 million copies in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>Daughtry&rsquo;s self-titled debut was the best-selling album of 2007, which contained four Top Twenty hit singles including the Grammy-nominated smash &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Over.&rdquo; Leave This Town also reached Number One in 2009, while 2011&rsquo;s Break the Spell was certified gold. His group&rsquo;s most recent record, 2013&rsquo;s Baptized, featured the platinum-selling &ldquo;Waiting for Superman,&rdquo; which the singer points to as a turning point in his songwriting.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was a nice hybrid of where we had been and where we&rsquo;re going, and it opened my eyes a bit,&rdquo; says Daughtry. &ldquo;Everything was so serious and doom and gloom, and &lsquo;You broke my heart,&rsquo; but we never saw ourselves as those people outside the music&mdash;onstage we were always joking around. That helped me wrap my head around the fact that we can be light-hearted and still be us. And that really changed the way I approach the songs in general.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Daughtry and his band have been performing together for over a decade. &ldquo;Like anything with a ten year relationship, you know more about each other than you do most of your family,&rdquo; says Chris Daughtry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a love-hate thing&mdash;you get sick of being around them, but after two weeks at home you&rsquo;re ready to get back out on the road and do it again. The fan base really keeps us alive. That&rsquo;s the key ingredient to keeping a band together&mdash;that&rsquo;s the gasoline, and without it you can&rsquo;t run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>One thing that has kept the fire burning for Daughtry has been the need to constantly challenge himself creatively. He has collaborated with artists from Timbaland to Vince Gill to Carlos Santana and took on the role of Judas Iscariot in the 2016 live television performance of The Passion, and even fulfilled a lifelong dream by drawing the cover of a Batman comic which was rated one of the top 25 covers of the year by BatmanNews.com.</p>\r\n<p>This kind of ambition has also extended to the work of Daughtry the band. &ldquo;We always try to push ourselves outside of the familiar parameters,&rdquo; says the singer. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything like we&rsquo;ve done before, then it&rsquo;s not good enough for the record.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at the groups doing it for twenty-plus years,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;they were always changing their style, testing the water, going off the rails from what people expected&mdash;Zeppelin, Elton, Prince, they never did the same record twice. So there&rsquo;s always that effort to push yourself as an artist, but I never want to abandon that sense of melody and sense of something that people can grab onto, whether it conjures up memories or helps them through a tough time. That&rsquo;s what I love about music, when it makes me feel something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As the band continues work on its fifth album (which Daughtry describes in its early stages as having a &ldquo;bluesy, almost rootsy undertone to it&rdquo;), they look to contemporaries like Maroon 5 and Train as examples of acts able to maintain their relevance while rock &amp; roll faces an uphill struggle in the mass media. &ldquo;Those guys are inspirational, showing that you can come back and have a strong presence, even if what you&rsquo;re known for doing is having a hard time,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>Ten years after launching with a massive splash, Chris Daughtry claims that he and the band have grown the most on stage, and that it&rsquo;s altered his whole sense of his work. &ldquo;When we first came out, I&rsquo;d only known what I&rsquo;d seen,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to be vulnerable, with no pretense. Now it&rsquo;s walk onstage and, especially in our acoustic shows, just be flat-out honest and open. It&rsquo;s really helped me realize that&rsquo;s actually what fans want&mdash;they want 100 percent honesty and feeling like they got to know you better.&rdquo;</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Pop Rock","Post Grunge","Nu Metal","Rap Metal"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fd370f0197099f81558819c9237af108/1b1eccf2/daughtry-tickets_11-29-21_18_60f0b78ff2dfc.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/purity-ring-tour-de-womb-12-01-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-02T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Purity Ring - tour de womb","Subtitle":"w/ Dawn Richard","Description":"<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">WOMB is the newest offering from Purity Ring of Edmonton, Canada, and their third album on 4AD.

From the album&rsquo;s opener &ldquo;Persephone&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Wilde Flowers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strange Brew&rdquo; to the album&rsquo;s counterpart title tracks &ldquo;Sorceress&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorceress II&rdquo;, Opeth&rsquo;s twelfth full-length is an unparalleled adventure, where visions cleverly and secretly change, colours mute as if weathered by time, and sounds challenge profoundly. <em>Sorceress</em> is, by definition, moored in &Aring;kerfeldt&rsquo;s impressive record collection&mdash;his one true vice&mdash;but, as always, there&rsquo;s more invention than appropriation at play.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This time around I didn&rsquo;t think about what I wanted to do,&rdquo; &Aring;kerfeldt reveals. &ldquo;I was forced to write. But once I started, it was easy. This record, like the last record, didn&rsquo;t take long to write. Like five or six months. The thoughts behind this record developed as I was writing. The only thing I was thinking about with this record was to write that songs didn&rsquo;t musically connect. I made sure if I had a song that was new sounding for this record, I&rsquo;d make the next song completely different. I think the songs are very different from one another. It&rsquo;s very diverse.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Certainly, every Opeth record has had diversity. In 1995, <em>Orchid</em> reset the rules of death metal. Six years later, <em>Blackwater Park</em> hit the high note for musicality in a genre generally devoid of it. <em>Damnation</em>, in 2003, was the work of a band determined to upend the norm. Five years after that, <em>Watershed</em> closed Opeth&rsquo;s chapter on death metal by visiting its darkest corners and holding its native brutality aloft. And in 2014, <em>Pale Communion</em> officially bridged the progressive music gap by twisting the intrepid sounds of &lsquo;60s, &lsquo;70s, and &lsquo;80s into contemporary brilliance. So, really, what&rsquo;s so different about <em>Sorceress</em>?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My music taste got a little wider,&rdquo; grins &Aring;kerfeldt. &ldquo;I started listening to jazz. I bought a lot of Coltrane records. I never really thought Coltrane would be for me because I like &lsquo;dinner jazz.&rsquo; I like comfortable, soft, nice, and lovely jazz. Like Miles Davis&rsquo; &lsquo;50s stuff. <em>Porgy and Bess</em>, for example. I guess Dave Brubeck fits in there, too. So, that&rsquo;s the only new influx of musical inspiration for me. Other than that, I&rsquo;ve been buying the same type of records I always have. Prog, symphonic rock, singer/songwriter, metal, hard rock&hellip; But there wasn&rsquo;t anything that set me off like The Zombies or Scott Walker. Nothing got me going this time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. &Aring;kerfeldt&rsquo;s always mining for progressive gold. Good, rare music is particularly good at getting his motor running. He found double-gold in one-off Italian outfit Il Paese dei Balocchi and Bobak, Jons, Malone&rsquo;s ultra-obscure <em>Motherlight</em> album. To wit, get &Aring;kerfeldt talking about either and he&rsquo;s all too pleased to discuss the finer points of Il Paese dei Balocchi&rsquo;s string-based darkness or how he fan-boyed Malone via email to get the famed British orchestrator and one-time Iron Maiden producer to contribute to <em>Sorceress</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I absolutely love Il Paese dei Balocchi,&rdquo; &Aring;kerfeldt professes. &ldquo;They did one album. It&rsquo;s insanely good. It has everything I love about progressive rock in it. This album is so orchestrated and epic. It&rsquo;s got lots of string sections. It&rsquo;s very moody, dark, and sad. It&rsquo;s a mystery they didn&rsquo;t do any more. As for Will Malone, he did the strings and stuff for the Sabbath records&mdash;<em>Sabotage</em> and <em>Never Say Die!</em> But now he does strings for pop artists like Joss Stone, The Verve, Depeche Mode. I looked him up, mostly because he was the house engineer for Morgan Studios in the &lsquo;60s. He was also in a few bands. Like Orange Bicycle and played on the <em>Motherlight</em> album. He also had a solo record, which is also amazing and superbly rare. It&rsquo;s orchestral. The bulk of it is strings. It&rsquo;s kind of like Nick Drake.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&Aring;kerfeldt&rsquo;s quick to point out, however, his newfound progressive music loves didn&rsquo;t directly inspire him to write <em>Sorceress</em>. The majority of the album was penned in Opeth&rsquo;s rehearsal space, where, nestled comfortably in a corner, a computer, a keyboard, and a microphone sit ready for the next Opeth epic. It isn&rsquo;t plush, but it&rsquo;s exactly the type of environment the frontman needs to focus his creative self into song.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m in a writing mode, I have tunnel vision,&rdquo; says &Aring;kerfeldt. &ldquo;I have a really good work ethic. I go down to the studio everyday early in the morning and I work. I absolutely love it. It&rsquo;s so much fun. It&rsquo;s much easier now, too. I write complete demos. I sequence the songs in the order I want them to be on the record. I do mixing. I do overdubs. Once I&rsquo;m done, I give copies to the guys so they can listen to the album. They practice to it on their own. When it&rsquo;s time to go into the studio, everybody does their own thing. It obviously works.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>For <em>Sorceress</em>, Opeth returned to Rockfield Studios in Wales, where the Swedes had tracked <em>Pale Communion</em> in 2014 with Tom Dalgety. The experience was so positive and historical&mdash;the countryside studio was also home to pivotal Budgie, Queen, Rush, Judas Priest, and Mike Oldfield recordings&mdash;there really was no other option for Opeth and crew. Rockfield Studios or bust! The studio, with Dalgety yet againin tow, provided the necessary isolation, the right bucolic atmosphere, the best gear, and three square meals a day for <em>Sorceress</em> to come out the other end spitting fire. All in 12 bittersweet days, too.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There was a time when I came out of our recordings a wreck,&rdquo; &Aring;kerfeldt bemoans. &ldquo;But now I come out with a wish. I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t have gone so quickly. There&rsquo;s emptiness after I leave the studio. I love writing and recording in the studio. It&rsquo;s lovely at Rockfield. It&rsquo;s in the sticks. It&rsquo;s got horses and cows. There&rsquo;s lots of sheep in Wales. But the studio is just a studio. It&rsquo;s so beautiful there. So quiet. It&rsquo;s a residential studio as well, so we live there while we&rsquo;re recording. We have chefs for us, too. So, we can just be there, playing, recording, and hanging out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>If life is like a Peter Max poster, the lyrics to <em>Sorceress</em> aren&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s color, but they&rsquo;ve been treated, corrupted, and befouled. That is to say, they&rsquo;re much darker. Some of bleak lyrical tones stem from &Aring;kerfeldt&rsquo;s personal life&mdash;and are thusly contorted beyond recognition&mdash;while others touch grimly on topics like love and what happens to people on the other side of it. In fact, some of the lyrical ideas are similar to what was happening on <em>Blackwater Park</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I made sure to write good lyrics,&rdquo; &Aring;kerfeldt laughs. &ldquo;This sounds very old-fashioned black metal to say, but the lyrics are misanthropic. It&rsquo;s not a concept record, so there&rsquo;s no theme running through the record. Most of the record deals with love. The negative aspects of love. The jealously, the bitterness, the paranoia, and the mind games of love. So, it&rsquo;s a love record. Love songs. Love can be like a disease or a spell.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Luckily, for &Aring;kerfeldt and crew&mdash;bassist Mart&iacute;n M&eacute;ndez, drummer Martin Axenrot, guitarist Fredrik &Aring;kesson, and keyboardist Joakim Svalberg&mdash;the lineup doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with <em>Sorceress</em>&rsquo; main theme. They&rsquo;ve been together since <em>Heritage</em> was completed, and according to &Aring;kerfeldt he&rsquo;s not been in a better band situation before. Not since <em>Orchid</em>. Not since <em>Still Life</em>. Not since <em>Ghost Reveries</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best band situation I&rsquo;ve ever had. Fans will look at our eras and have their favorite lineup, but this is the best. Even the happiest days of the first and second lineups aren&rsquo;t comparable to what I have now. We never fight. It&rsquo;s like a good work team. We know each other professionally and personally. As much as we&rsquo;re a band, we&rsquo;re also friends. We hang out when we&rsquo;re not doing Opeth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A core team is a good thing, when Opeth&rsquo;s credibility is in full view of fans and critics. &Aring;kerfeldt&rsquo;s very aware of what the masses have had to say about Opeth since <em>Watershed</em>. While some disliked the musical shift on <em>Heritage</em>, most have applauded it. They&rsquo;ve come to expect something new from Opeth. True to form, <em>Sorceress</em> will give long-time fans and weary critics reason to re-think Opeth and what it takes to be musically fearless.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll like the record,&rdquo; posits &Aring;kerfeldt. &ldquo;I can only talk from my perspective and taste here, but we offer diversity that&rsquo;s not really present in the scene today. Whatever genre. We&rsquo;ve always been a special band. We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of shit for being different. We still do. Our time will come, I think. It comes down to perseverance. It comes down to not giving up or giving in to public opinion. Music is about doing your own thing or going your own way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Opeth &ndash; Biography 2016</p>\r\n<p>By Chris Dick</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Alternative Metal","Swedish Metal","Atlanta Metal","Progressive Groove Metal"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/49b45268ddc524674f3ddc970f885031/54d5f1a1/opeth-mastodon-tickets_12-05-21_18_613a7c1b937df.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/thundercat-12-07-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-08T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Thundercat","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Afrofuturism","Indie Soul"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/827b12a270894e06cce9c52cc41c7a96/52847eb0/ea7abfdf-ab50-4587-88dc-ed6877931f04_1451851_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/chvrches-12-08-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-09T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"CHVRCHES","Subtitle":"with special guest Donna Missal","Description":"<span dir=\"ltr\"><span>CHVRCHES are Lauren Mayberry, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.

Massively inspired by their idyllic surroundings&mdash;and a sense of charmed isolation that frontman Jim James likened to &ldquo;living on our own little moon&rdquo;&mdash;the Kentucky-bred five-piece ended up creating over two dozen songs at the mountaintop studio known as Panoramic House. Though they flirted with the idea of putting out what would have been a triple album, the band ultimately decided that less would be more at the time and divided the project into two halves, releasing the first segment as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall</em>: a 2015 full-length that earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. My Morning Jacket are now set to share the second half of the project as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II</em>, an unforeseen and timely continuation of a psychic and sonic journey begun long ago.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>As James reveals, the decision to unearth&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>was sparked from a bit of serendipity in the early days of self-quarantine. While out on a walk, he placed his music library on shuffle and soon stumbled upon &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo; a tender rumination on the struggle for presence, its lyrics confessing to feeling &ldquo;hypnotized from doing the same old thing.&rdquo; Struck by the song&rsquo;s enduring relevance, James revisited the other tracks reserved from the Panoramic House sessions and found that they invited a welcome moment of self-reflection&mdash;an outcome perhaps even more perfectly suited to the chaos of the current day than the circumstances of their recording.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>mines its mood of dreamy contemplation from certain heartbreak James had recently experienced, including the demise of a monumental relationship. Unfolding in a loosely threaded narrative of loss and recovery, the album conjures an indelible pain but never drifts into despair, gracefully conveying James&rsquo;s message that &ldquo;there is hope beyond the pain and loss, if you learn to flow with life like water.&rdquo;</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Opening with the profound reverie of &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>endlessly illuminates My Morning Jacket&rsquo;s eclectic sensibilities, encompassing everything from lilting sunshine-pop to fantastically ramshackle rock and roll. While the album slips into heavenly psychedelia on tracks like &ldquo;Feel You&rdquo; (a mesmerizing epic James developed deep in the Muir Woods), a more ominous tone permeates &ldquo;Magic Bullet&rdquo; and its rattled response to gun violence. An intimate documenting of keeping an open heart in the face of devastation,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>embodies a wistful longing on &ldquo;Run It&rdquo; (a song about &ldquo;the desire to disappear and turn back into water,&rdquo; according to James) and later gives way to overwhelming gratitude on &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; (a portrait of &ldquo;coming home from tour feeling so sad and defeated and lonely, but realizing how much love I was lucky to have in my friends and family&rdquo;). And on &ldquo;The First Time,&rdquo; My Morning Jacket close out the album with a sweetly rambling meditation on the possibility of finding love again, channeling both ineffable sorrow and wide-eyed hope to incredibly glorious effect.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Even in its most heavy-hearted moments,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>radiates an undeniable sense of wonder, a testament to the wild-mindedness that&rsquo;s long imbued the music of My Morning Jacket. With their unabashed curiosity infinitely stirred by their time at Stinson Beach, the band hopes that the album might lead others to look beyond what&rsquo;s human-made in the search for solace and renewal. &ldquo;As so many of us feel out of tune and long for the world to be a better place, we have to look to nature and the animals and learn from them: learn to love, accept, move on, and respect each other,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;We gotta work for it and change our ways before it&rsquo;s too late, and get in harmony with love and equality for all of humanity and for nature too.</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7de0016072c5e08b3111d18f27348b21/29018e11/my-morning-jacket-tickets_12-29-21_18_61094f2b86142.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/my-morning-jacket-12-30-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-31T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"My Morning Jacket","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/346db64309e9f0e8749923baf5d24d02/cb0694bf/cc81d18c-d94e-4d9a-8627-d8109b6e55b0_1437431_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/dillon-francis-x-yung-gravy-01-27-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-01-28T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Dillon Francis x Yung Gravy","Subtitle":"Kittens","Description":"<p>By 2017, platinum-selling DJ and producer, host and creator of TBS Digital&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>One Deeper Talks, </em>actor, and all-around nice guy&nbsp;<strong>Dillon Francis&nbsp;</strong>solidified himself as modern-day renaissance man.

Right now, the Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter is riding a creative tidal wave, firing out acclaimed albums, hooking up with the biggest names in music and rocking the house each night with that celebrated burnt-honey voice. In 2016, the headline news is Beth&rsquo;s latest album, Fire On The Floor (out 14 October 2016 (Europe / Australia / New Zealand) and 3 February 2017 (US / Canada) on Provogue/Mascot Label Group): a release that even this fiercely self-critical artist describes as &ldquo;pretty frickin&rsquo; good&rdquo;. But let&rsquo;s not forget the backstory that brought her here&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>The Blues Magazine once dubbed Beth Hart &ldquo;the ultimate female rock star&rdquo;, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that her two-decade career is the ultimate thrill-ride. Born in Los Angeles, she released a fistful of hit albums through the &rsquo;90s, then reignited in the post-millennium as both a solo artist and the head-turning vocalist for guitar heroes like Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and Slash. &ldquo;Extraordinary,&rdquo; wrote The Times of her once-a-generation voicebox, while The Guardian praised her &ldquo;daring, brooding and angry&rdquo; performances. It&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s been nominated for three Blues Music Awards.</p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s in recent times that Beth has truly blossomed. In April 2015, she released Better Than Home: a critical and commercial smash that topped the iTunes Blues Chart and was crowned #4 Best Blues Album Of The Year by Mojo magazine. The release led her to fill Amsterdam&rsquo;s Heineken Music Hall with 5,500 fans (her largest club show to date). &ldquo;Oh, that was so good, man,&rdquo; she reflects. &ldquo;I love Holland. They&rsquo;ve been really good to me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The US has embraced her, too, packing ever-larger venues in major cities on the Better Than Home tour &ndash; including Nashville&rsquo;s iconic Ryman Auditorium &ndash; and receiving a nomination from the American Blues Foundation in the category of Contemporary Blues Female Artist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;This last tour, we were playing much bigger houses than I&rsquo;d ever played in the States &ndash; and they were sold-out.&rdquo; Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Beth&rsquo;s rocketing UK profile has never been higher. Recent years have seen auspicious headline sets at the Royal Albert Hall and the Barbican (not to mention the historic Hampton Court Palace with Joe Bonamassa), and in December 2015, she chalked up another first with a spot on Jools Holland&rsquo;s legendary annual Hootenanny.</p>\r\n<p>Bringing in the New Year with a soulful take on Tell Her You Belong To Me and Nutbush City Limits alongside long-time collaborator Jeff Beck, it spoke volumes that the pair&rsquo;s performance rapidly became the Hootenanny&rsquo;s most-watched clip on the BBC&rsquo;s official YouTube channel (even overtaking heavyweights like Tom Jones and Paul Weller). &ldquo;Every time Jeff performs, he just kills it,&rdquo; gushes Beth, who also joins the veteran guitarist for her first-ever appearance at the Hollywood Bowl this year. &ldquo;To me, he&rsquo;s the greatest ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Just as memorable, also last December, was Beth&rsquo;s first solo gig at London&rsquo;s Union Chapel (subsequently voted by fans as the venue&rsquo;s gig of the year). &ldquo;It was the most terrifying experience of my entire life,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I got up there and I was so frickin&rsquo; scared. But then, halfway through the show, I just started to enjoy it. By the end, I felt so connected to the audience, and I really felt like they did that show with me. It was like we were all the band.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fire On The Floor is sure to build on her breakneck momentum. The record gave her an emotional release following the bitter-sweet sessions for Better Than Home. Fire On The Floor is the album that Beth Hart needed to make.

The Parisian duo rose to global prominence eliciting a summery musical hedonism that flicks like frames through Golden Era Hollywood films &mdash; think romance-thrillers in Saint Tropez or love-crossed youth in Rio de Janeiro. With the release of their long-awaited sophomore LP&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>, Polo &amp; Pan further refine their cinematic impressions on house, disco, club, techno, and psychedelia in arrangements that play out like vignettes, abstractions on the motif of voyage that traverse through locales, time, tempo, and the cycles of life.\r\n<div><em><br />Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;is Polo &amp; Pan fully realized: hedonism matured, sounds fine-tuned, scope broadened. While standouts like &ldquo;Feel Good&rdquo; and the ELO-inspired &ldquo;Magic&rdquo; are cued up to soundtrack the world&rsquo;s revelers emerging again into a joyful daylight world, Polo &amp; Pan are also exploring shades of darkness and introspection. &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jiminy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo; &mdash; the latter a collaboration with the Compton-bred club iconoclast Channel Tres &mdash; take the duo&rsquo;s sonic late into the realm of all-night sessions, awash with brooding mystique.&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;also finds Polo &amp; Pan foraying to the fringes of dancefloor thematics, exploring life, death, and transcendence in tracks like the buoyant and celebratory &ldquo;Ani Kuni&rdquo; and the wistful psychedelic ballad &lsquo;Melody.&rsquo;<br /><br />\r\n<div>Throughout the&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;journey, Polo &amp; Pan offer richer textures, more complex emotions, intrepid collaborations, and surprises like the emergence of Paul Armand-Delille&rsquo;s dulcet vocals.

So while&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama&nbsp;</em>may be a watershed in the scope of the duo&rsquo;s sound, the feeling the music brings to the dancefloor remains uncompromisingly, inimitably, and undoubtedly Polo &amp; Pan.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["French Indietronica","Dark Disco","New French Touch","Electro Pop Francais"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c5dd3d6a884804c329a7012549b0ee4/e87e281a/polo-pan-tickets_02-10-22_18_60b7e43621ffd.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/sullivan-king-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Sullivan King","Subtitle":"LAYZ","Description":"<p class=\"normal\" align=\"center\"><em>&ldquo;If DJs are today&rsquo;s rock stars, then Sullivan King is forging his own rock galaxy</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\" align=\"center\"><strong>- <em>LA Weekly</em></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><strong>Sullivan King,</strong> the one-half metal, one-half bass music artistic creation of <strong>Keaton</strong> <strong>Prescott</strong>, will embark on an international tour through the end of&nbsp; 2019 and into early 2020.

A few EPs later, Boris moved from Autist Records to Harthouse. With tracks like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Die Maschinen Sind Gestrandet&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Lost Memory&rdquo;</em>, he combined his unique sound with a maximum of varieties. Consequently, he became the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;exceptional Talent 2007&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in the electronic music magazine Raveline. Boris also created his second alias called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;ANNA&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2007 and had some groundbreaking releases on Autist Records.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>After four years of touring, three albums and lots of singles, Boris became a constant favorite in today's club scene. With his ambition and desire for new and experimental musical directions, he shows his audiences over and over again how exciting minimal techno can be - so much more than just a conglomerate of repetitive and puristic elements.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris created his own music genre&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;High-Tech Minimal&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2012 which has often been referred to as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;the intelligent music of tomorrow&rdquo;</em>. After seven years of working together with Harthouse and his fourth album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Feuerfalter&rdquo;</em>, Boris founded his own label called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Fckng Serious&rdquo;</em>. Together with his best friends Ann Clue and Deniz Bul they want to spread their idea of good music and serious parties around the globe.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In the beginning of 2016, Boris came up with his 5th album called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;22&rdquo;</em>. His unbelievable passion for music combined with the longtime experience as a producer for different genres fuses into this exclusive distinctive and very special sound. Beside that, Boris created his own&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha In Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;show which he first played in Brazil in 2016. These events, a combination of synced visuals, his Joker mask and his music, are a special and unique experience.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 2017, Fckng Serious was the first electronic music label to do a Europe Bus Tour with the full crew travelling on a Nightliner through Europe to play 10 shows in 12 days. Like Rockstars!\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Just a year later we also saw Boris making his much-anticipated debut at Tomorrowland, the Exit Festival as well as the legendary Time Warp. A second sold-out bus tour, this time through France, proved to be successful yet again. In General, things didn't get any slower but even bigger than ever before.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris&rsquo; success story received a further boost in 2019. He already enjoys a superstar status around the world, but that&rsquo;s not enough yet. He sold out huge clubs in the USA within minutes and almost everyone knows him. It is impossible to imagine the techno scene without him and he has earned his place there. Many new singles appeared in 2019 and the number of his listeners spoke volumes. Since 2019 Boris is also under contract with the well-known label&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ultra Music</em>&rdquo;. His music has also been played on the radio. With his specially created&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha in Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;shows, he filled huge halls with up to 15,000 people without any problems.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In 2020, his success story begins even more promisingly than in the previous year. He started the year with a long-awaited album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Space Diver&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and he has already had a talk show appearance on German television. His name already adorns numerous line-ups of the most famous festivals around the world. USA, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia are just a few of the countries where Boris will be performing again this year. Besides a documentary about his life, we can look forward to many new surprises this year.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["German House","German Techno","Minimal Techno","High Tech Minimal"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/90b3837573af56e4408dbb80b12a9b27/9800591c/boris-brejcha-tickets_03-04-22_18_6125260391b79.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/grace-potter-03-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-29T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Grace Potter","Subtitle":"with Bailen","Description":"In the years that followed the release of her widely acclaimed 2015 album Midnight, Grace Potter considered never putting out a record again. Having endured the tumult of the breakup of her band and subsequent divorce&mdash; as well as far more joyful events like a new marriage and the birth of her first child&mdash; Potter continued writing on her own, but had no intention of sharing those songs with the world. &ldquo;Too many things had happened, and I needed to take a step back,&rdquo; says the Vermont-born artist. &ldquo;There were moments where I thought, &lsquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll just go back to painting houses.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBut by the end of 2017, Potter began to feel the call of the studio and soon started laying down tracks in the Topanga Canyon home she&rsquo;d recently settled into with her husband, Midnight producer Eric Valentine. Unsigned and entirely free of any pressure to appease, Potter slowly carved out the songs that now make up Daylight: an album that emerges as her most emotionally revealing, musically daring, and exactingly realized body of work to date.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&ldquo;In the past, I&rsquo;ve aimed to write songs from a universal perspective; so that anyone who heard my music could relate, but that actually made it harder for me to take ownership of my own perspective. This new collection of songs were all written so that I could process &ndash; and be accountable for &ndash; my own life experience,&rdquo; Potter says. &ldquo;I had just pulled the ripcord on my whole life. It was an incredibly jarring, private experience. When the dust settled a bit, the last thing I wanted to do was tell the whole world about it. It was a very gradual process of re-framing music and its purpose in my life. So when I finally started writing songs again - I did it for me.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"284\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"285\">Potter&rsquo;s seventh full-length and first release for Fantasy Records, Daylight was created in close collaboration with producer/mixer/engineer Eric Valentine. In constructing the album&rsquo;s wild collage of rock-and-roll, blues and soul, Potter tapped into her tightly honed musicianship while harnessing the untamed energy of her live performance for the very first time. &ldquo;I had kind of resigned myself to the fact that I was always going to be better live than in the studio - but Eric was determined to tap into that raw energy that I have onstage.&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He chased down a few different approaches, ultimately creating a kind of live music venue setup in his studio, so I could feel the sound reflecting off the walls and interact with the band instead of just singing into a void.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span>\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"284\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"285\"><br /></span></span>\r\nPartly recorded in Potter&rsquo;s garage and living room, Daylight mostly came to life through a series of liveto-tape sessions at Valentine&rsquo;s Hollywood studio, Barefoot Recording. Along with capturing the undeniable vocal power Potter&rsquo;s previously shown in sharing the stage with The Rolling Stones, Robert Plant, and Neil Young, the album unfolds with an irresistibly vital sound birthed with the help of guests like Benmont Tench and Lucius. &ldquo;Having all these incredible musicians playing live in the room with me gave the recording an urgency&mdash;like, this matters right now,&rdquo; Potter recalls.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOn the album-opener &ldquo;Love Is Love,&rdquo; Potter brings that urgency to a breathtaking slow-burner, her voice shifting from fragile to soaring with understated elegance. The very first piece written for Daylight, the track finds Potter fully surrendering to unbridled feeling&mdash;a process so unsettling, it temporarily put her off from attempting any further self-examination in song form. &ldquo;&lsquo;Love Is Love&rsquo; is so confessional, it was terrifying. I dove deep into the darkest corners of my personal life.&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;After we recorded the demo, I had no desire to keep on writing because the feelings were still too raw. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to dig any deeper.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"289\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"290\">&nbsp;Just one song later, Potter proves to have wholly conquered that fear, turning out a full-tilt rocker raging with pure passion. With her vocals taking on a gravelly intensity, &ldquo;On My Way&rdquo; telegraphs unhinged joy as Potter documents a particularly fraught moment from the past few years when she took a solo drive across the country. &ldquo;Once you allow certain feelings in, there&rsquo;s no turning back.&rdquo; Freewheeling and cathartic, &ldquo;On My Way&rdquo; builds its frenetic tension in part from a riff that she and Valentine conjured up on their back porch. &ldquo;Musically, it&rsquo;s meant to take you in two directions&mdash;there&rsquo;s a powerful tension between darkness &amp; light. It&rsquo;s a theme that plays out a lot on this record, and that riff kinda just says it all.&rdquo; Potter notes.&nbsp;</span></span>\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"289\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"290\"><br /></span></span>\r\nThroughout Daylight, Potter imbues her songs with equal parts aching vulnerability and unapologetic self-possession. A stark piano ballad partly written while Potter was in the process of moving out of her home, &ldquo;Release&rdquo; transmits a quiet sorrow but ultimately finds its resolution in a lyric supplied by cowriter Mike Busbee (&ldquo;I hope that someday/The sun will shine again/And you&rsquo;ll release me too&rdquo;). On &ldquo;Repossession,&rdquo; meanwhile, Potter sharply contrasts the song&rsquo;s sleepy rhythm, dreamy guitar tones, and unearthly harmonies with a brilliant lyrical barb (&ldquo;And you say/That I threw it all away for nothing/But the only thing I threw away/Was you&rdquo;). &ldquo;We were driving through the Southwest; we stopped at a pawnshop and bought this busted old guitar with a missing string, dragged it out to these vast sand dunes and just started playing,&rdquo; Potter recalls in revealing the song&rsquo;s origins. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d been listening to a lot of classic country and AM radio on the road trip. These heart-wrenching songs spoke directly to what we were going through - and even though they were recorded over 50 years ago, it felt like they&rsquo;d been reading my diary - so when we sat down to write, &lsquo;Repossession&rsquo; just happened. Like it had always been there, just waiting for someone to show up and claim it.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhile much of Daylight mirrors the emotional chaos of her recent past, the album also channels a certain soulful wonder on songs like &ldquo;Every Heartbeat,&rdquo; an acoustic-guitar-laced serenade for Valentine and their infant son, Sagan. And on &ldquo;Desire,&rdquo; Daylight drifts into an unpredictably playful mood, serving up a sweetly winking celebration of unabashed lust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often cloaked my carnal themes in metaphor.&rdquo; Potter notes. &ldquo;Ultimately that approach lost a lot value for me. I was tired of burying my desires, my truth, my pain&hellip;in euphemisms. I had to start over &amp; rebuild my sense of self, so I went straight to the source with a song that celebrates the fact that we&rsquo;re all just animals.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOn the title track and finale to Daylight, Potter offers up one of the album&rsquo;s most galvanizing and glorious moments: a shapeshifting epic that endlessly careens from simmering blues lament to brutally thunderous rock-and-roll anthem. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a song about the darkest time.&rdquo; Potter recalls. &ldquo;We started composing that song because we wanted to honor the long, difficult process of finding peace. It&rsquo;s a musical bookmark; and a reminder that darkness doesn&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFor Potter, the making of Daylight marks a return to the unfettered creativity she felt upon first discovering songwriting. &ldquo;I really dug back into the roots of my creativity.

And that can be absolutely terrifying&mdash; but once you get to the other side, it&rsquo;s exhilarating.

My current responsehas been that it sounds like Syd Barrett meets A$AP Rocky and they get trapped in a fairy tale from the future.. Ha.. Knowing fulwell that if you know who Syd Barrett is.. (original founder of classic rock/space opera group Pink Floyd) you probably DON&rsquo;T know who A$AP Rocky is (current badass psychedelic rapper).. and if you know and like A$AP Rocky you probablydon&rsquo;t care or wouldn&rsquo;t like Syd Barrett.. Ha..<br /> <br />So yeah.. I think, perhaps, it is only within The Flaming Lips world that these 2 (Syd and A$AP) could accidentally find themselves, like Dorothy stumbling upon the scarecrow as she wondered down the yellow brick road towards&nbsp;Oz..<br />(not sure which one is Dorothy and which one is the scarecrow in this scenario..) But somehow they have gone through a hole in the night sky and arrived in a fucked up, day glow, fairy tale world in the future.. A future where Oczy Mlody is the current cool powerful party drug of choice and sleeping is the ultimate cure for everything.. sleeping for, like,3 months.. Yeah sleeping.. So if you want to lose weight.. Ping!! You are put to sleep for 3 months and you wake up thin.. If you are addicted to drugs.. Ping!! You sleep yourself out of withdrawals and cravings and wake up sober.. Ha.. And it all takes place inside a gated community that has been made into a replicant fantasy fairy tale city where the mega-mega rich folks live and have self indulgent psycho parties (maybe I&rsquo;ve been spending too much time around Miley Cyrus) where everyone takes Oczy Mlody (the drug uses your own sub-conscious memories and transports you to your perfect childhood happy mind) and everyone has sex while riding unicorns.. There are frogs and wizards and spiders and painful emotional therapy sessions where every primal desire is allowed and encouraged. Darkness in the dark while we listen with demon eyes on our way back home to our family.. WTF..<br /> <br />We began, what now has become, Oczy Mlody as far back as January 2015. The opening track called Oczy Mlody&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZqXj0RLV1RI\" target=\"_blank\"><span>(watch&nbsp;a&nbsp;video:&nbsp;Wayne&rsquo;s&nbsp;Explanation&nbsp;of&nbsp;Oczy&nbsp;Mlody)</span></a></span>&nbsp;was haphazardly conceived one night from two recording session . The descending bass and slow drum machine stuff from one night and the magical crystalline melody synth line that was recorded the next night. It was just an off the cuff little moment but it kept haunting me (in a good way).. Ha.. I would keep returning to this simple, really nothing, of a track. It (the Oczy Mlody recording) has a kind of mellow suspen-sion about it. Something sooothing and soft and science sleep experiment sounding about it. It is all vibe vibe vibey. My attempts to actually turn it into a song never worked and it remained this moody piece of wordless music and sound that compelled me. Maybe it is, or was, the type of mood or mindset I had been searching for but only knew it subconsciously. I think that must be music&rsquo;s greatest power.. it somehow swirls around in your mind and touches things and opens things that you could never consciously touch or open.. It&rsquo;s a motherfucker..</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">About&nbsp;five&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago&nbsp;I&nbsp;found&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;paperback&nbsp;book&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;used&nbsp;bookstore.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pmD88mVXO0I\" target=\"_blank\">(watch&nbsp;a&nbsp;video:&nbsp;Wayne&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the&nbsp;book)</a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I liked the cover, a painting of a woman that looks like Eryka Baddu crying and sweating,and the title Blisko Domu. I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant. It&rsquo;s written in Polish (Blisko Domu means Almost Home).. But I didn&rsquo;t care. I liked it and it is on of the books I have in the studio that I would look at all the time in between mixes and slow recording times. I would read it as a kind of meditation. Meaningless (well, meaningless to me.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t speak Polish) sentences and paragraphs.<br /> <br />I would flow over the text like I was reading but It would never alight any story.. occasionally I would stumble upon cool sounding words and phrases not having any idea of their real mean- ing and I think I would allow the words to trigger something, maybe something subconscious, in my searching mind. I stumbled upon the words &ldquo;Oczy Mlody&rdquo;.. they struck me as sounding like Oxy (as in Oxycodone) Melody and, as my imagination ran away with it, also the name of a drug made in the future. Every time I would pick this book up I would, kind of, add to the made-up meaning that I had given to The actual meaning of &ldquo;oczy mlody&rdquo; is something like &ldquo;eyes of the young&rdquo;.. which we (Steven and Dennis and I) thought was great.. Eyes Of The Young is not really the words that I liked.. a title that appealed to us but Oczy Mlody meaning &ldquo;eyes of the young &ldquo;greatly appealed to us..Ha.. Who knows why.. And so we began to realize we were starting to make a record with this kind of removed,abstract substitute meaning.. or a record that we followed what meaning the initial sounds triggered... Sounds of words. Sounds of music. Sounds of beats..</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/074e01fbc6941d9f589f2fd799753fe3/2f386d54/the-flaming-lips-tickets_06-09-20_18_5edfb7043fdfc.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/lorde-04-27-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-04-28T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Lorde","Subtitle":null,"Description":"<p><span>In 2013, a 16-year-old LORDE quietly, yet confidently asserted herself as the voice of a generation with her full-length debut,&nbsp;</span><em>Pure Heroine</em><span>.
