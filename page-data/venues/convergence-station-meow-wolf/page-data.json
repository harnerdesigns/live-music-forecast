If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\nIsrael Vibration was founded by Cecil \"Skelly\" Spence (born in 1952), Lacelle \"Wiss\" Bulgin (born in 1955), and Albert \"Apple Gabriel\" Craig (born in 1955, deceased in 2020). They were victims of the polio epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950's. Skelly, Wiss, and Apple met at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic in Kingston, where they got together to fund the group a few years later. Skelly and Wiss were members of the first musical group from Mona, the SKA Band \"Hot Lickers\", which appeared on TV when Skelly was only 12 years old. Apple attended Alpha Boys School, the musical birthplace of many legendary Jamaican artists.\n\nThe three young men adopted Rastafarian faith and decided to create a vocal group, initially called \"Israel Vibration, Israel Vibrates”, soon renamed to \"Israel Vibration.\" In the beginning, they knocked at the doors of many studios, meeting different producers who used to listen to them acknowledging their talent, but without giving a chance to record.\n\nEverything started to change when in 1975, they were at the gate of Channel One Studios. Maurice \"Blacka Morwell\" Wellington (one of the founding members of the Morwells alongside Errol \"Flabba\" Holt) saw them over there, auditioned them at the gate and let them in. Flabba was there on this day also. They recorded their first song \"Bad Intention\" with Skelly on lead vocals, but the track was not released.\n\nTwelve Tribes of Israel, an essential branch of Rastafari faith, gave them great support in that period through the person of Hugh Booth, one of their members. The Twelve Tribes label took them to record their debut single that was released - \"Why Worry”, a song that has an important message to connect people to God. The track was released in late 1976 and got massive distribution in early 1977. The single was successful and placed them on the spotlights to be the opening act for other artists, such as Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley.\n\nAfter that, they started to work with producer Tommy Cowan and released the single \"The Same Song\" through his Top Ranking label in 1977. The single was followed by the album of the same name in 1978 and \"Israel Tafari\" (aka \"The Same Song DUB\"). \"The Same Song\" (and its DUB version) were very successful internationally, leading Israel Vibration to a deal with EMI. The album was reissued in the UK, and they also started working on a second album, \"Unconquered People\", recorded later at Tuff Gong Studios and backed by members of The Wailers band.\n\nTheir third album, \"Why You so Craven\", produced by Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes, was released in 1981, a year in which the dancehall movement started to grow steadily in Jamaica. After relocating to New York in 1982, the group split and reunited only in 1987, after getting positive feedback from Gary \"Dr. Dread\" Hilmefarb, founder of RAS Records. That was the beginning of an era.\n\nThey were flown to Washington, DC to record a new album at the Lion and Fox Recording Studios in Maryland, backed by the Roots Radics. The backing band, led by Errol \"Flabba\" Holt, Eric \"Bingy Bunny\" Lamont (both ex-members of the Morwells), still works with Israel Vibration until today. The album recorded was \"Strength of My Life\", released in 1988. The partnership with RAS lasted for years, and they recorded some more essential albums for Reggae Music industry: \"Praises\" (1990), \"Forever\" (1991), \"Vibes Alive\" (1992), \"IV\" (1993), \"On the Rock\" (1995), \"Free to Move\" (1996), \"Live Again\" (1997), \"Pay the Piper\" (1998), and \"Jericho\" (2000). Some of these albums also gained a DUB Version.\n\nIn 1997 Apple Gabriel left the group and started a solo career. Skelly and Wiss continued to record albums and are touring the world since then as Israel Vibration & the Roots Radics band. They played in major Reggae Festivals and Clubs for huge crowds and still headline some of the most important musical events of the world after over 45 years in music. In 2010 they got their first Grammy Nomination with \"Reggae Knights\". If you are new to their music and message, just mention the name Israel Vibration to any Reggae enthusiast in the world and get their reaction. This group is history.\n\nSocial Media\ninstagram.com/realisraelvibration\n\nOfficial Website\nrealisraelvibration.com","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4484eeb8dcf809e2675b3e44b583c523/66c36cf8/dc20968c-3d28-874d-96ab-29732ee040e6"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/flor-03-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-29T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"flor","Subtitle":null,"Description":"DOORS 8:00PM | SHOW 9:00PM | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Grace began experimenting with electronic music-making programs to create ear-catching synth sounds. Bauld built tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that updated the sound of the '80s for the 21st century. After moving to Los Angeles, Flor connected with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who helped the band come up with distinctive visuals; meanwhile, Bauld established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like Halsey, Lights, Smallpools and Lostboycrow. The band released its debut single, \"Heart,\" online in 2014, with the Sounds EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length Sights & Sounds, Flor signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2016, which reissued the Sounds EP that February.

This nonstop world-touring artist found his signature sound through his numerous productions and live sets, all characterized by a melodic style of techno.\n\nThe adventure began in 2007 when he released his first hit \"Air conditionné\", which quickly ranked #1 in Beatport sales – the first of a long series of number ones to come. \nIn 2010, Julian signed with two prestigious labels: Cocoon, on which he released the “Color” EP – its single \"Soho\" ranked #1 in the Beatport Techno Top 100 -, and Plus 8 Records. The same year, the “Techno Corner” EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof's label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (“Stay Down”). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP, ‘Hermanos’ with Plus 8 Records.\n \nIn 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP). One year later, he started the year with two remixes for prestigious artists Deadmau5 & Pan-Pot that both charted #1 in the Beatport Techno Top Ten. They were followed by the excellent “Mad” EP with Form Music. He also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin's renowned label: “Don't Think” EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), “She's Hot” EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track \"Unanswered question\" on Drumcode – which went straight at Number 1 on Beatport.   In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: “Rumble” and “Los Pistolos” EP.\n\nIn 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, “Bird”, on Minus and a remix, “COAR,” commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored. Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released – commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist’s greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport’s monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks: “And We”, “Meteorite”, “Bird” and “Wax”. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. \n\nIn 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, “Destination”, an instant success, followed by two equally successful remixes for Matador & Felix da Housecat, “The Enemy” (Rukus) and « Fuego » for Dubfire & Oliver Huntemann (Senso). One year later, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, “Rolling” and “Space”.\n\nIn 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, “Transmission” LP, also on Drumcode. The album was an early 2019 monstrous hit, generating multiple Beatport chart-toppers and hitting the Top 3 All Genres charts. \n\nThe year 2020 saw another successful release on Drumcode, “Schema” EP, a remix in March for Klaudia Gawlas on Form Music (“Time Loop”) and a long-awaited collaboration EP with POPOF : “Dance Escape” (Filth on Acid), released this Fall. More recently, Julian Jeweil has released a remix for Reinier Zonneveld “Eating Concreté’’ on Filth On Acid.

To date his off kilter sounds have come in the form of EPs on labels like 3024, Rush Hour and Running Back, and have been carefully crafted things, layered with musicality whilst never straying too far from a infectious groove.\n\nTaking obvious foundations from house, techno, disco, funk, hip-hop and soul, Vynehall's music incorporates many elements from his musical past too: his journey began with playing drums and the piano in bands as a teenager -- which manifests itself in the raw, live sound he strives for in his productions -- while much of his spare time is spent listening to anything from classical and orchestral compositions to post-punk. His work has seen him dabble in tempos, palettes and styles, but all the time managing to keep his songs coherently 'Vynehall.'\n\n\"I like chords, I like atmosphere and some sort of emotion in music. Rather than it being just about the dance floor, I like it being a bit of both. I like to take a sound and change it, manipulating things so they sound a bit dusty. With drums, I like to make them sound more human. I prefer dance music that isn't quantized, regimented, and super mixed down to the nano-perfect spot. I'm a believer in the fact that music doesn't have to sound professional to sound great. Mastering engineers hate me.\"\n\nHis 2014 release, 'Music For The Uninvited,' was a turning point in his career. Resident Advisor scored the EP a 4.5 out of five, calling it \"one of the most eclectic and rewarding house records you'll hear all year.\" Clash wrote that, \"If this is what being uninvited is like, we're totally cool with missing the party,\" while The Washington Post said that it \"couldn't be much more of a delight.\" It went on to gain end of year accolades from publications as wide ranging as Pitchfork, NPR and Gorilla vs. Bear, and saw Vynehall begin a relentless touring schedule that has taken him from Berlin's Panorama Bar and Ibiza's DC-10 to festival stages as far afield as Los Angeles, Sydney and Tokyo.\n\n'Rojus' -- the 2016 follow up to 'Music For The Uninvited' -- was equally acclaimed, being named 'Best New Music' by Pitchfork, 'Best Album' at the DJ Mag Awards, and lauded by the likes of Mixmag, Billboard and Mojo.\n\nVynehall's DJ style is eclectic, considered and always surprising, and has been expertly reflected in his popular mixes for the likes of FACT and XLR8R, with the latter commenting that his contribution to their podcast series \"quite possibly raised more questions than it answered.\" His debut Radio 1 Essential Mix proved so popular that it went on to be shortlisted by the BBC as one of the 5 best Essential Mixes of 2016. Something of a media recluse, all we really know about Leon Vynehall is from his music -- so far it's proved a fascinating story.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ca1d7ca7dfef3dd7a672af1816684473/9a154620/c04cd3c2-32f7-7b05-3495-74ff2e9f2bee"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/fleetmac-wood-05-13-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-14T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Fleetmac Wood","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 9:00PM | Show 10:00PM | 18+\n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.
