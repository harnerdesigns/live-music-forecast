Recorded at Swingfingers Studios in Fort Collins (Colorado), the band brought a larger band than ever before, including drummer Darren Garvey of Elephant Revival, Vocalist Kim Dawson, Dobroist Todd Livingston, a horn section and more. The material reflects both the turbulent social rhythms of our current era and more timeless moments of joy, growth, and change.\n\nLike a painter that starts in acrylic and graduates to oils, Head for the Hills is deeper and richer in their 15th year as a band, with a wider palette of sonic textures at their disposal.  Dorm room jam sessions have turned into a decade plus on the road--from humble coffee shops to theaters, festivals, roadhouses and clubs all across the country. Over time those sounds and influences have crept more and more into the bluegrass beginnings of the band, morphing into the seasoned eclecticism of Say Your Mind.

Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, mandolin, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f4f7826330128d64d129351b04e2f461/b6b7ad96/aff4c6d0-622e-53e1-1722-e812c906b241"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/yonder-mountain-string-band-02-24-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-25T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Yonder Mountain String Band","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 8:00pm | Show 9:00pm \n\nWith its latest album Get Yourself Outside, Colorado-based quintet Yonder  Mountain String Band once again echoes out into the universe its place as not  only a pioneering jam-grass act, but also one of the most innovative, intricate  groups in the live music scene which is reinforced by its newest member, multi instrumentalist Nick Piccininni.  \nIt‚Äôs a testament to the life and legacy of Yonder that three of the  founding members ‚Äî guitarist Adam Aijala, bassist Ben Kaufmann and  banjoist Dave Johnston ‚Äî remain at the helm of this American musical  institution, something complemented and accelerated in recent years by the  fiery fiddle work of Allie Kral, who joined the group in 2015.  \n\nThe new album boasts a reinvigorated energy alongside the usual foot-stomping  melodies and sorrowful ballads that reside at the core of the Yonder Mountain  signature sound. \n\nYonder Mountain was the initial spark in an acoustic inferno decades ago that  endures headlong into the 21st century.\n","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cf6e28ed6b8b2c09329d8a41596dfcca/3f2d45ca/52f98f64-0a6e-0f47-07db-d9f3a0d71e13"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/sabo-02-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-26T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Sabo","Subtitle":null,"Description":"9:00PM Doors | 10:00PM Show \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‚ÄòThe Sad Piano‚Äô on Ben Watt‚Äôs Buzzin‚Äô Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin‚Äôs sound as ‚Äòmelodic and tough‚Äô with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you‚Äôre sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.‚Äù\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for R√ºf√ºs Du Sol and Ultra√≠sta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin‚Äôs label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‚ÄòWhat To Do...‚Äô, kicking things off with his first single ‚ÄòNeeds‚Äô. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound.

Often referred to as ‚ÄúThe Master of Emotion‚Äù his music is patently beautiful and melodic.  With diverse influences ranging from trip-hop, classical and Arabic to bass driven compositions, his songs are considered anthemic and timeless.  As a multi-instrumentalist and singer, his tracks are organic, uplifting and stand on their own as a distinct genre.  Listeners of all types of music can find something they can relate to in his sound.  He has toured extensively across North America, including tours with Bassnectar, Shpongle, Emancipator, Beats Antique, and has headlined dozens festivals across the U.S. and internationally. \n\nThere is no doubt that Rab understands a multitude of musical styles.  He has been the front man of a heavy metal band, toured as a classical trumpet player, played bass in a country music band, was a scratch DJ for a jazz fusion project, was the singer for a rock band in Mexico and has collaborated with countless musicians of all styles.  From acoustic performances in the Himalayas to rocking packed clubs in New York, Random Rab has found a way to connect with people of all kinds. \n\nWith a dedicated fanbase born from the San Francisco underground, Random Rab has become known worldwide for his sunrise sets that have now become one of his most sought after performances.  Having played before 3 solar eclipses and at the Pyramids of Giza, Random Rab has created a unique niche for his equally danceable, yet thought-provoking compositions.    His current popularity can often be traced to his breakout album, The Elucidation of Sorrow and in particular his first hit, The Riddle and followed up by hits such as Release, Falling Tao, For My Corpse and Apparently.  His critically acclaimed current and 10th album Formless Edge, catapulted him into the state of momentum that is now taking hold internationally.  \n\n<H3>  Equanimous </H3> \n\nEquanimous is a music producer, DJ, and multi-instrumentalist. He combines elements of downtempo, bass, house, and melodic dance music to create a joyous high vibrational atmosphere on the dance @loor. Equanimous expands the electronic music experience by playing live djembe, keys, and beatboxing along with his tracks. He‚Äôs known for his deep bass, beautiful melodies, live looping, and creative rhythmic beats that take people into a state of euphoric dancing and heart-centered bliss.\n\n<H3> Skysia </H3> \n\nForgoing electronic music‚Äôs inherent heaviness for a spiritualized serenity and elegant songcraft, Skysia fuses elements of melodic bass, chill-step, and modern downtempo into a euphonious sound. The producer/composer often reveals a minimalist, deliciously danceable style; his translucent low-end theory is rich in musicality and steeped in dreamy psychedelia. Born Tanner Allen, Skysia is a self-taught pianist, filmmaker, and production wizard; formerly based in Southern California, these days he lives in a converted mini-school bus - complete with mobile studio, crafting sound art while perpetually immersed in nature. Skysia mines earthy textures and unveils emotive tones, sonically expressing the delicate balance between darkness and light. His crisp, clear compositions invoke the sacred and sexy, humbly channeled through medicinal bass music. Drawing inspiration from global dancefloor pioneers like Bonobo and CloZee. Before embarking on a musical journey on the West Coast scene, Allen studied production techniques at the esteemed Point Blank Music School in London.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9dfa431e2165d674e5176b87dd53338a/d99c39cb/9623d5a1-9a44-52b6-daec-15d955a8abc9"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/ross-from-friends-03-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-10T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Ross from Friends","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Ross From Friends, AKA British producer Felix Clary Weatherall, released his keenly anticipated second album ‚ÄòTread‚Äô on 22nd October via Flying Lotus‚Äô Brainfeeder imprint. An artist who demonstrates an ever-increasing mastery of his craft, ‚ÄòTread‚Äô is a record that is at once sleek and melodic but also eminently danceable, nostalgic but brilliantly modern, with nods to sounds and styles that are not so much reflected but refracted and recontextualised through Clary Weatherall‚Äôs lens.\n\nIn 2018‚Äîfollowing a handful of revered and sought-after singles and EPs throughout the mid-2010‚Äôs on labels such as Breaker Breaker, Lobster Theremin, Distant Hawaii, Magicwire and Molten Jets‚ÄîRoss From Friends announced his signing to Flying Lotus‚Äô legendary Brainfeeder label with the release of his ‚ÄòAphelion‚Äô EP. Accelerating a sonic shift that continues to this day, the release was characterised by an obsessive attention to detail that manages to marry an intricately layered production style with warm, heavily saturated sonics and emotive songwriting.\n\nThis was followed the same year by his debut album ‚ÄòFamily Portrait‚Äô‚Äîthe culmination of almost two years of intense studio time, working 20 hour days, and often spending months perfecting just one aspect of a track. ‚ÄòFamily Portrait‚Äô was hailed as ‚Äúa powerful debut‚Äù by Crack Magazine and was described by Mixmag as ‚Äúa gliding and glittering tour de force‚Äù in their ‚ÄòAlbums of the Year 2018‚Äô roundup. NME praised Clary Weatherall‚Äôs unique sonic identity as ‚Äúa mind-melting picture that takes in house, techno, jazz and ambient music, and ties it together to make something distinctly unique‚Äù and Rolling Stone declared him ‚Äúa master of fun, gooey textures‚Äù. Similar praise came from the likes of Resident Advisor, The Wire, Pitchfork, AV Club, Loud & Quiet, DJ Mag, Clash, PopMatters, FADER and more.\n\nOn an album that was dedicated to, and inspired in part, by his parents, a particular highlight was the release of the official video for ‚ÄúPale Blue Dot‚Äù. Made up of footage shot by his mum when she and his dad had just met, the video follows his parents-to-be on a bus trip around Europe in 1990, travelling through France, Belgium, West and East Germany (though returning through a unified one) and beyond, setting up their makeshift sound system in towns and villages in order to share their passion for the sounds of hi-NRG dance, Italo disco and proto-Techno through spontaneous parties in whatever venue they could find.\n\n2019‚Äôs ‚ÄòEpiphany‚Äô EP, also on Brainfeeder, was dedicated to (and named after) Clary Weatherall‚Äôs sister: ‚ÄúOne of the most important role models I have‚Äù he said at the time. Constructed with the dancefloor at the forefront of his mind, the three tracks assembled on ‚ÄúEpiphany‚Äù represented a sleeker and tougher sound than his acclaimed debut, but with his signature warmth and personality is ever present. Continuing his interest in the visual realm the EP artwork was created by legendary pro skateboarder artist Chad Muska, and the titular lead single came with an animated video directed by Theo Nunn (Lisbon Studio), guiding the viewer through a psychedelic sci-fi dystopia.\n\nMore recently, Clary Weatherall launched his own label Scarlet Tiger as an outlet for releasing his own productions alongside ‚Äúfriends and folk I‚Äôve met online over the years‚Äù, marking the inaugural release with his own ‚ÄòBurner‚Äô single in January 2021, followed by an EP from RFF band mate Cameo Blush, and most recently by an EP from Giulia Tess in August.\n\nNow, Ross From Friends has released ‚ÄòTread‚Äô, a showcase of his ever evolving talent, dailling up the intricate and emotive qualities of his production style that have previously led Mixmag to praise his ‚Äúidiosyncratic dexterity that not only makes your heart ache, but dance right out of your chest‚Äù. Central to the creation of ‚ÄòTread‚Äô is ‚ÄúThresho‚Äù, a piece of software designed and built by Felix himself ‚Äîand available via Ableton‚Äôs Max For Live platform‚Äîthat starts recording once the audio hits a user-defined threshold, then stops once it goes below that threshold, automatically saving and indexing the resulting clips alongside timestamps. This led to a revelation in how he approached the production and writing on ‚ÄòTread‚Äô, and meant he spent the first six months just experimenting with his hardware, not actually committing to any music, but with ‚ÄúThresho‚Äù quietly recording everything he was doing, each session leaving its mark on an ever expanding library of his own samples. When he later came to composing the album, he was then able to draw on specific moments, either recalling the exact date or time he had made a recording, or simply browsing the now vast audio library of his own making. \n\nWith ‚ÄòThresho‚Äô being so integral to the album Felix also made the decision to share this vast bank of recordings that were the foundations of ‚ÄòTread‚Äô and in doing so, offer up a peek behind the scenes at the creative process of one electronic music‚Äôs most individual and compelling voices. Fans have been invited to explore this resource and share their interpretations, versions, iterations and interactions.\n\nA cornerstone of Ross From Friends music has always been the blistering Ross From Friends 3-man live show‚Äîcomprising Felix, Jed Hampson & John Dunk‚Äîthat delivers a killer blend of live musicianship (guitar, keys and sax) and electronics and has graced stages at the likes of Coachella, Glastonbury, Primavera and Sonar to name a few. With multiple sold-out dates across previous tours throughout the UK, EU, Australia and North America, the trio are returning to a headline tour in the UK, Europe and North America in 2022.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e0331a411ad396a0c96a4b90dec18bf2/cf8d0498/ac21ab8c-f95f-4dbb-9689-d0b8698975d3"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/dimond-saints-03-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-12T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Dimond Saints","Subtitle":null,"Description":"9:00PM Doors | 10:00PM Show | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

Canadian musician Jeff Hartford‚Äôs enthusiasm for music began at a young age, he grew up playing in bands and learning instruments like piano, trumpet, and guitar. His immersion in songwriting continued to grow when he attended university, and he interned for a composer after completing his courses. It was during this time that he started applying the techniques he‚Äôd learned in the studio to electronic music and began sending his completed works to deadmau5‚Äôs mau5trap label. The label initially signed a few tracks and then ATTLAS as an artist, and Hartford released three EPs in 2015 via the Canadian imprint. In the years since then, he‚Äôs delivered singles, EPs, and remixes ‚Äì all showcasing the textured, introspective sound he‚Äôs spent years cultivating. 2019 brought exciting new developments to the ATTLAS journey, including a new installment of his lauded Storyline series and a debut album. The album ‚Äúsynthesized all the experiences and wandering paths that ATTLAS walks,‚Äù according to Hartford, bringing together heavier sounds and the emotive melodies he‚Äôs built his musical brand on. 2020 proved difficult for everyone; Hartford included who was forced to cancel his ‚ÄòLavender God Tour‚Äô, named for his debut album. Rather than focusing on the missed opportunities, Jeff has taken this year to dive even deeper into his musical craft. After a few one off releases and several remixes, including a captivating melodic single ‚ÄúThe Night Air Was Cool‚Äù, Jeff released his second album at the top of November. The latest album, titled ‚ÄòOut Here With You‚Äô, encompasses the shift in the music industry and the way we‚Äôre digesting music without live touring. Rawer and more intimate than ever before, ‚ÄòOut Here With You‚Äô is Jeff‚Äôs way of showing his fans and the world that we were not alone during this troubling time and that we‚Äôre all trying to navigate the state of the current world together. 2021 brought new heights to Jeff‚Äôs career, most notably a Juno nomination for Best Electronic album for his inaugural ‚ÄòLavender God‚Äô. iding off the high of this great honor, Jeff has gotten back on the road touring and is excited to drop his 3rd album later this year on Mau5trap. Be sure to keep an eye on this one, for this is just the beginning for ATTLAS.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/af51c9c1224f606cea961cf2d9fbf679/13a79bfb/55e1ad47-0b46-f580-cd51-405a706b162a"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/summer-salt-03-22-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-23T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Summer Salt","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 8:00PM | Show 9:00PM | All-Ages \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

Now, they‚Äôre ready to ruminate on what they‚Äôve left behind.\n\nIn a way, the trop-pop duo ‚Äì singer/guitarist Matthew Terry and drummer Eugene Chung ‚Äì have been building to their brand-new album, SEQUOIA MOON, ever since jettisoning their Dallas, Texas, hometown for the arts-and-culture oasis of Austin after graduating high school in the early 2010s. The band quickly rose through the ranks of the local Austin scene with their 2014 debut Driving To Hawaii, teeming with both the escapism and recklessness of youth and the composure and charm of ‚Äò60s-era pop, doo wop and bossa nova.\n\n2018‚Äôs Happy Camper, 2019‚Äôs Honeyweed and 2020‚Äôs Avenue G further cemented the band‚Äôs place as one of the indie genre‚Äôs brightest stars. Summer Salt soared past 1 million monthly Spotify listeners and toured the world, all as Live Nation‚Äôs Ones To Watch and American Songwriter hailed them for their breezy, synesthetic soundscapes.\n\nThat streak will continue with SEQUOIA MOON. Produced by Phil Ek (Modest Mouse, Built To Spill, Fleet Foxes), the 12-song set, due out June 25 through Cherry Lime Records via The Orchard, finds Terry and Chung contemplating many of the same themes that drove them to pursue their dreams a decade ago ‚Äì leaving, longing, returning back again ‚Äì with the benefit of years in the rearview mirror.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of running away on this album,‚Äù Terry says, noting SEQUOIA MOON is, at its core, a record about transitions: intrapersonally, interpersonally, and in the scope of the world at large. The songs are culled from diverse periods throughout the band‚Äôs history ‚Äì standout ‚ÄúColors Of Your Love,‚Äù among others, dates all the way back to 2013 ‚Äì but their themes are timeless and indelible, detailing life at its most basic: the push toward a bright, bold future while looking back fondly on what‚Äôs led you there.\n\nThat juxtaposition is well represented musically, too. The hallmarks of Summer Salt are alive and well ‚Äì the jazzy dynamism of ‚ÄúHocus Pocus‚Äù and first single ‚ÄúMonday‚Äôs Facil,‚Äù the peaceful solemnity of ‚ÄúTrouble In Paradise‚Äù ‚Äì while newer elements like synths and additional percussion push the band‚Äôs sound forward with a newfound moodiness and tension.\n\nTerry hails Chung as a grounding presence to his own eccentric, blue-sky extravagance, and when the principals meet in the middle on SEQUOIA MOON, listeners are left with the edge and emotion of the band‚Äôs early work filtered through a more mature lens. As such, the album stands as another hallmark in a career of era-defying art that spans genres and generations ‚Äì offering audiences the perfect blend between substance and sunniness.\n\n‚ÄúWe loved writing this album with the hope that other people can relate to our stories and bring them some peace this summer,‚Äù Chung says.

They were victims of the polio epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950's. Skelly, Wiss, and Apple met at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic in Kingston, where they got together to fund the group a few years later. Skelly and Wiss were members of the first musical group from Mona, the SKA Band \"Hot Lickers\", which appeared on TV when Skelly was only 12 years old. Apple attended Alpha Boys School, the musical birthplace of many legendary Jamaican artists.\n\nThe three young men adopted Rastafarian faith and decided to create a vocal group, initially called \"Israel Vibration, Israel Vibrates‚Äù, soon renamed to \"Israel Vibration.\" In the beginning, they knocked at the doors of many studios, meeting different producers who used to listen to them acknowledging their talent, but without giving a chance to record.\n\nEverything started to change when in 1975, they were at the gate of Channel One Studios. Maurice \"Blacka Morwell\" Wellington (one of the founding members of the Morwells alongside Errol \"Flabba\" Holt) saw them over there, auditioned them at the gate and let them in. Flabba was there on this day also. They recorded their first song \"Bad Intention\" with Skelly on lead vocals, but the track was not released.\n\nTwelve Tribes of Israel, an essential branch of Rastafari faith, gave them great support in that period through the person of Hugh Booth, one of their members. The Twelve Tribes label took them to record their debut single that was released - \"Why Worry‚Äù, a song that has an important message to connect people to God. The track was released in late 1976 and got massive distribution in early 1977. The single was successful and placed them on the spotlights to be the opening act for other artists, such as Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley.\n\nAfter that, they started to work with producer Tommy Cowan and released the single \"The Same Song\" through his Top Ranking label in 1977. The single was followed by the album of the same name in 1978 and \"Israel Tafari\" (aka \"The Same Song DUB\"). \"The Same Song\" (and its DUB version) were very successful internationally, leading Israel Vibration to a deal with EMI. The album was reissued in the UK, and they also started working on a second album, \"Unconquered People\", recorded later at Tuff Gong Studios and backed by members of The Wailers band.\n\nTheir third album, \"Why You so Craven\", produced by Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes, was released in 1981, a year in which the dancehall movement started to grow steadily in Jamaica. After relocating to New York in 1982, the group split and reunited only in 1987, after getting positive feedback from Gary \"Dr. Dread\" Hilmefarb, founder of RAS Records. That was the beginning of an era.\n\nThey were flown to Washington, DC to record a new album at the Lion and Fox Recording Studios in Maryland, backed by the Roots Radics. The backing band, led by Errol \"Flabba\" Holt, Eric \"Bingy Bunny\" Lamont (both ex-members of the Morwells), still works with Israel Vibration until today. The album recorded was \"Strength of My Life\", released in 1988. The partnership with RAS lasted for years, and they recorded some more essential albums for Reggae Music industry: \"Praises\" (1990), \"Forever\" (1991), \"Vibes Alive\" (1992), \"IV\" (1993), \"On the Rock\" (1995), \"Free to Move\" (1996), \"Live Again\" (1997), \"Pay the Piper\" (1998), and \"Jericho\" (2000). Some of these albums also gained a DUB Version.\n\nIn 1997 Apple Gabriel left the group and started a solo career. Skelly and Wiss continued to record albums and are touring the world since then as Israel Vibration & the Roots Radics band. They played in major Reggae Festivals and Clubs for huge crowds and still headline some of the most important musical events of the world after over 45 years in music. In 2010 they got their first Grammy Nomination with \"Reggae Knights\". If you are new to their music and message, just mention the name Israel Vibration to any Reggae enthusiast in the world and get their reaction. This group is history.\n\nSocial Media\ninstagram.com/realisraelvibration\n\nOfficial Website\nrealisraelvibration.com","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4484eeb8dcf809e2675b3e44b583c523/66c36cf8/dc20968c-3d28-874d-96ab-29732ee040e6"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/flor-03-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-29T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"flor","Subtitle":null,"Description":"DOORS 8:00PM | SHOW 9:00PM | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Grace began experimenting with electronic music-making programs to create ear-catching synth sounds. Bauld built tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that updated the sound of the '80s for the 21st century. After moving to Los Angeles, Flor connected with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who helped the band come up with distinctive visuals; meanwhile, Bauld established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like Halsey, Lights, Smallpools and Lostboycrow. The band released its debut single, \"Heart,\" online in 2014, with the Sounds EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length Sights & Sounds, Flor signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2016, which reissued the Sounds EP that February. The band's first album for the label, come out. you're hiding, was released in May 2017.

This nonstop world-touring artist found his signature sound through his numerous productions and live sets, all characterized by a melodic style of techno.\n\nThe adventure began in 2007 when he released his first hit \"Air conditionn√©\", which quickly ranked #1 in Beatport sales ‚Äì the first of a long series of number ones to come.‚Ä®\nIn 2010, Julian signed with two prestigious labels: Cocoon, on which he released the ‚ÄúColor‚Äù EP ‚Äì its single \"Soho\" ranked #1 in the Beatport Techno Top 100 -, and Plus 8 Records. The same year, the ‚ÄúTechno Corner‚Äù EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof's label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (‚ÄúStay Down‚Äù). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP, ‚ÄòHermanos‚Äô with Plus 8 Records.\n \nIn 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP). One year later, he started the year with two remixes for prestigious artists Deadmau5 & Pan-Pot that both charted #1 in the Beatport Techno Top Ten. They were followed by the excellent ‚ÄúMad‚Äù EP with Form Music. He also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin's renowned label: ‚ÄúDon't Think‚Äù EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), ‚ÄúShe's Hot‚Äù EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track \"Unanswered question\" on Drumcode ‚Äì which went straight at Number 1 on Beatport.   In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: ‚ÄúRumble‚Äù and ‚ÄúLos Pistolos‚Äù EP.\n\nIn 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, ‚ÄúBird‚Äù, on Minus and a remix, ‚ÄúCOAR,‚Äù commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored. Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released ‚Äì commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist‚Äôs greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport‚Äôs monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks: ‚ÄúAnd We‚Äù, ‚ÄúMeteorite‚Äù, ‚ÄúBird‚Äù and ‚ÄúWax‚Äù. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. \n\nIn 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, ‚ÄúDestination‚Äù, an instant success, followed by two equally successful remixes for Matador & Felix da Housecat, ‚ÄúThe Enemy‚Äù (Rukus) and ¬´ Fuego ¬ª for Dubfire & Oliver Huntemann (Senso). One year later, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, ‚ÄúRolling‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù.\n\nIn 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, ‚ÄúTransmission‚Äù LP, also on Drumcode.

To date his off kilter sounds have come in the form of EPs on labels like 3024, Rush Hour and Running Back, and have been carefully crafted things, layered with musicality whilst never straying too far from a infectious groove.\n\nTaking obvious foundations from house, techno, disco, funk, hip-hop and soul, Vynehall's music incorporates many elements from his musical past too: his journey began with playing drums and the piano in bands as a teenager -- which manifests itself in the raw, live sound he strives for in his productions -- while much of his spare time is spent listening to anything from classical and orchestral compositions to post-punk. His work has seen him dabble in tempos, palettes and styles, but all the time managing to keep his songs coherently 'Vynehall.'\n\n\"I like chords, I like atmosphere and some sort of emotion in music. Rather than it being just about the dance floor, I like it being a bit of both. I like to take a sound and change it, manipulating things so they sound a bit dusty. With drums, I like to make them sound more human. I prefer dance music that isn't quantized, regimented, and super mixed down to the nano-perfect spot. I'm a believer in the fact that music doesn't have to sound professional to sound great. Mastering engineers hate me.\"\n\nHis 2014 release, 'Music For The Uninvited,' was a turning point in his career. Resident Advisor scored the EP a 4.5 out of five, calling it \"one of the most eclectic and rewarding house records you'll hear all year.\" Clash wrote that, \"If this is what being uninvited is like, we're totally cool with missing the party,\" while The Washington Post said that it \"couldn't be much more of a delight.\" It went on to gain end of year accolades from publications as wide ranging as Pitchfork, NPR and Gorilla vs. Bear, and saw Vynehall begin a relentless touring schedule that has taken him from Berlin's Panorama Bar and Ibiza's DC-10 to festival stages as far afield as Los Angeles, Sydney and Tokyo.\n\n'Rojus' -- the 2016 follow up to 'Music For The Uninvited' -- was equally acclaimed, being named 'Best New Music' by Pitchfork, 'Best Album' at the DJ Mag Awards, and lauded by the likes of Mixmag, Billboard and Mojo.\n\nVynehall's DJ style is eclectic, considered and always surprising, and has been expertly reflected in his popular mixes for the likes of FACT and XLR8R, with the latter commenting that his contribution to their podcast series \"quite possibly raised more questions than it answered.\" His debut Radio 1 Essential Mix proved so popular that it went on to be shortlisted by the BBC as one of the 5 best Essential Mixes of 2016. Something of a media recluse, all we really know about Leon Vynehall is from his music -- so far it's proved a fascinating story.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ca1d7ca7dfef3dd7a672af1816684473/9a154620/c04cd3c2-32f7-7b05-3495-74ff2e9f2bee"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/fleetmac-wood-05-13-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-14T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Fleetmac Wood","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 9:00PM | Show 10:00PM | 18+\n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.
