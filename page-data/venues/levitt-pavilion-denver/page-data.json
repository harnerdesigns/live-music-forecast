The ever-shifting repertoire draws from homegrown idioms steeped in traditional Americana, folk, blues, jazz, and rock and roll, with a healthy dose of the avant-garde. Dig deeper into the songs, their storylines, and the characters inhabiting them, and youll find enduring tales of murder and intrigue, gamblers and thieves, sinners and saints, tales of everyman, mythic and surreal, blue-collar rhapsodies in a kaleidoscopic tapestry awash in color, sound, and light.Shakedown Streets own story finds them continuing to play to enthusiastic sold-out audiences, while marching up and down, going around and around their beloved home in the mountains of Colorado. The band happily finds itself in the trusted role of connecting past, present and future Grateful Dead fans with the vital and vibrant energies of improvisational live music. Endlessly fun, exciting, dramatic, uplifting, inspirational. The band and audience in concert. A reset for the soul!","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785648&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1b2726c21e03522a"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-altons-with-wes-watkins-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-03T23:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Altons (with Wes Watkins)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"The Altons (with Wes Watkins)DOORS OPEN: 4:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, April 21st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 22nd - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, May 19th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

The Altons, natives of the region, combine dust kicked up from backyard parties with evening Art Laboe listening sessions, evoking a sound that veers far from the shadows. The Altons curate a ballad of retro-indie-soul that has captivated local audiences for several years, quickly driving them to become a staple of the scene. Their distinct sound caught the attention of Daptone Records Co-founder Gabe Roth, who was in the process of starting Penrose Records. Penrose became a subsidiary label to Daptone to highlight the emerging soul-scene growing in Southern California, where The Altons fit perfectly.Their Penrose debut When You Go (Thats When Youll Know) was KCRWs Todays Top Tune, and their most recent single Tangled Up In You has been featured on Soulection Radio.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/02dbacd115c6064199bed385427b349c/e45448bc/2352e3b5-8496-496b-97a3-e605177e848b_105851_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785648&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=fb9bac5c29d025f7"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-suffers-with-adiel-mitchell-07-08-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-09T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Suffers (with Adiel Mitchell)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"The Suffers (with Adiel Mitchell)DOORS OPEN: 5:30pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, May 26th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

NPRs Bob Boilen attributes the bands allure to their Soul, straight from horn to heart. He adds, This band is on fire when its in front of an audience...but the intensity of their shows are also captured in the studio. Following The Suffers electrifying late night TV debut on Lettermanin 2015, David Letterman exclaimed, If you cant do this, get out of the business! There is something undeniable about The Suffers (whose name is a reference to the1978 Jamaican film Rockers starring Leroy Horsemouth Wallace, Jacob Miller and Burning Spear, among others), that instantly hits home with their audiences. We make music for all people, says lead vocalist Kam Franklin. At this point, weve played all over the world and one thing is certain-if the music is good, the people will enjoy it. Since 2011, the H-Town heroes have been on a steady grind and have no plans of stopping.The Suffers exploded onto the scene in 2015 with their dazzling EP Make Some Room, which was followed by their critically heralded self-titled debut in 2016. The Suffers released their latest record Everything Here on Shanachie Records July 13, 2018. Everything Here is the bands most bold statement yet. Lead Singer Kam Franklin states, Our hope is that our fans walk away feeling empowered, resilient, and inspired to live a better life.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5ab0e7f3156d85a6f31413ece5d1fe00/3d10fd16/2e303aae-9afa-4fff-a883-4fa94945fa13_5641_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=632779f0c87137a7"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-with-the-claudettes-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band (with the Claudettes)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"The Reverend Peytons Big Damn Band (with the Claudettes)DOORS OPEN: 4:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, May 26th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

Rev. Peyton, the Big Damn Bands vocalist and world-class fingerstyle guitarist, details bleak financial challenges on the songs Ways and Means and Dirty Hustlin. He pines for in-person reunions with loved ones on No Tellin When, and he pleads for celestial relief on the album-closing Come Down Angels.Far from a depressing listen, Dance Songs lives up to its name by delivering action-packed riffs and rhythms across 11 songs. The country blues trio that won over crowds on more than one Warped Tour knows how to make an audience move.I like songs that sound happy but are actually very sad, Peyton says. I dont know why it is, but I just do.Of course, the greatest front-porch blues band in the world found itself sidelined from a relentless touring schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic. Peyton says he was surprised when his mind and soul unleashed a batch of new songs in March and April of 2020.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/017fa79dfe4190af0bac62403cab07a0/de9a8256/32bd8764-1ed9-4881-9067-11c26a515186_880511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785650&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0dcd22cdc69ddba3"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/jessica-lea-mayfield-with-desp-air-jordan-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Jessica Lea Mayfield (with despAIR jordan)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Jessica Lea Mayfield (with despAIR jordan)DOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, June 2nd - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

They began touring as a family band, boarding a 1956 tour bus (once belonging to Bill Monroe, Kitty Wells, and Ernest Tubb) and headed south from Ohio to Tennessee. At age 11, Mayfield began playing guitar and writing songs.At age 15, Mayfield recorded her first album White Lies under the moniker Chittlin, printing only a few hundred copies. One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. After an introduction, Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio, laying the foundation of her debut album With Blasphemy So Heartfelt. Pitchfork Media gave the record a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Online magazine Blurt named the record the Best Album of 2008 and gave Mayfield the title of Best New Artist of 2008.Her latest record, Sorry is Gone was released in 2017 and detailed her years of quietly enduring domestic abuse by her then-husband.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1c6798f0f6db2a64f893fcbc8a13ff18/7fe2a3f5/1cae9108-6a98-4696-9f32-b075d16e90fc_619361_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1656785650&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6ca4d5c4c2e6950d"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/drive-by-truckers-with-buffalo-nichols-07-15-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-16T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Drive By Truckers (with Buffalo Nichols)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Drive By TruckersDOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, June 2nd - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

Just in time to celebrate our 25th birthday. The band had just released its 12th studio album in January 2020. The Unraveling was mostly recorded in Memphis at Sam Phillips Recording Service nine new songs detailing the horrific state of MAGA America in songs that addressed white supremacy, school shootings and the opioid crisis. The album earned excellent reviews (including later being named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone in France) and we set out on the road playing shows up the east coast including NYC, Boston and DC. Unfortunately, the pandemic happened and we only completed one three-week leg of what was supposed to be a 15-month tour. In lockdown, we all did what we could. Cooley, Jay and I played numerous virtual shows from our respective homes. Matt Patton built up his already successful studio (Dial Back Sound in Water Valley, MS) and album productions including acclaimed records from Bette Smith and Jimbo Mathus. Jay Gonzalez released his third excellent solo album Back to the Hive.Turn it up loud and see you at the Rock and Roll Show,Patterson Hood","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/64b2d71b097d5832e43e39e1dc86c1d7/160542e7/8be3d654-e6e9-411a-9d78-f5e966e012ea_1590991_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1656785650&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=477067d86f324d9c"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/mo-lowda-the-humble-07-16-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-17T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Mo Lowda & the Humble","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Mo Lowda & the HumbleDOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 10th - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, March 11th - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, June 2nd - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

The latest album, Ready Coat came into existence after the decision to add a touring member enabled the band to expand its sonic ability. This opportunity to stretch the bands sound and add elements which would have previously been impossible to play live, enabled them to self-produce, engineer, and mix a record without considering limitations. There are absolutely no words to express the bandʼs anticipation and excitement for finally being able to play these new songs (as well as many, many others) live on tour.

A few years later Fela Kuti came calling. Kaleta would go on to tour the world playing guitar for the King of Afrobeat in his storied band Egypt 80 through the 1980s and into the 1990s.Now based in New York City, Kaleta has been leading Super Yamba Band since 2017. Their debut album Mdaho, which was released by California indie label Ubiquity Records, draws on the groups shared reverence for the raw, psychedelic sounds that captivated Kaleta as a music loving kid in 1970s Benin. Mdaho means big brother, elder or teacher and is dedicated to Kaletas late brother Ligan-Ozavino Pascal who introduced him to funk and soul music at a very early age. The album was included on Bandcamps Best Albums of Summer 2019 list and two of the songs were chosen for the ABC/Hulu series High Fidelity staring Zoe Kravitz.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f742b229f132ac55c9c8c96b36279cdd/084e1ba6/5fefbd1c-973b-4b0e-9b2e-d78e4ce37548_106111_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785648&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=c1c9f7a6bd0dcbe8"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/y-la-bamba-with-kayla-marque-08-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-14T23:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Y La Bamba (with Kayla Marque)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Y La Bamba (with Kayla Marque)DOORS OPEN: 4:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, April 21st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 22nd - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, June 30th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

Learn more at allianceformusicedequity.org.Y La BambaY La Bamba has been many things, but at the heart of it is singer-songwriter Luz Elena Mendozas inquisitive sense of self. Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based bands affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPRs Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendozas artistic voice like never before. Soy como soy, Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold even political statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bambas most unbridled offering yet.Mujeres was recorded by Luz Elena Mendoza and Ryan Oxford at Color Therapy Studios and Besitos Fritos Studios in Portland, Oregon. Mixed by Jeff Bond, with Grace Bugbee on bass, John Niekrasz on drums, Margaret Wher Gibson on keys, and Ed Rodriguez and Ryan Oxford on electric guitar.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785651&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1eaa70127d5a7918"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/big-time-rush-forever-tour-08-16-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-17T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Big Time Rush: Forever Tour","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Pop","Boy Band","Post Teen Pop"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/92fa4eb355d2a09ffd966aa14286b3a3/30955b20/8b62bfc2-e0bb-4a29-92d7-a6acb870eed5_1619321_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=f91563b30055ec6f"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/elvis-costello-the-imposters-08-23-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-24T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Elvis Costello & the Imposters","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Gates open @ 5:30 PM","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5796fdb544b0f3d017c045b129964e0c/cb7d1be9/b6c339ae-db12-4a01-add3-3e48253cb3e0_1613401_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785651&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=89eb6fc1c524a0bc"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/calvin-arsenia-with-nina-de-freitas-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Calvin Arsenia (with Nina de Freitas)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Calvin Arsenia (with Nina de Freitas)DOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 3rd - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, March 4th - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, July 14th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

Voted Kansas Citys Best Musician 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 (PitchKC), and featured on Billboard.com, NPR.org, NEWNOWNEXT, Pride.com, and GRAMMY.com, Arsenias angelic stylings on voice and harp create rare harmonies and arrangements that look past the boundaries of his traditional gospel and classical upbringing. Known for his elaborate and ceremonious sensory concert experiences that merge jazz and electronic influences, Calvin has consistently deliver(s) genre-bending (and gender-bending) shows that tackle sexuality, religion, and race in a stunningly unorthodox manner - somewhere between sacred and sacrilege. A healthy serving of indie rock, neo-soul, R&B, and a splash of art pop, this multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter is a shimmering force to be reckoned with. Jeff Buckley meets Nina Simone with this soul of Sam Cooke, and the sparkle of Bjork. The music is just one part of his prodigious performances, for Calvin believes the art is in crafting the perfect moment. His music is best served live, with sensational performances and high fashion from the visually striking performer who stands at 66. Arsenias height, energy, and curated environments fill the often intimate spaces he performs in. Brought into 9 countries through public and private grants in less than a decade, Arsenia builds a scene for his audience and for himself, packed with beauty and lasting delight.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4b0a2651b9fb56d1dc79845360afc858/2b7e021e/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cae3509dd474f265"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/colorado-is-for-lovers-08-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-28T17:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Colorado Is For Lovers","Subtitle":null,"Description":"General Admission Only SEATING: No chairs are provided, this show is all lawn seating.

Brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters understand one another at the purest level. When families rally around music, they speak this oft-unspoken bond aloud and into existence. After 25 years, twelve albums, four GRAMMY Award nominations, and sold out shows everywhere, North Mississippi Allstars open up their world once again on their thirteenth album, SetSail [NewWestRecords], welcoming other family (by blood and by the road) into the fold. As legend has it, Luther and Cody Dickinson started the band in 1996 as a loose collective of like-minded second-generation musicians who shared a local repertoire and regional style. Over the years, the lineup shifted by design, and each subsequent record offered up a different combination of collaborators. This time around, they mined the talents of Jesse Williamson bass and Lamar Williams, JR. on vocals. During the Allman Betts Band Family Revival, the Dickinsons first linked up with Lamar, son of the Allman Brothers bassist Lamar Williams, Sr., becoming fast friends and collaborators and eventually paving the way for Set Sail.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c81fee8f93fd704338b932f70da302af/103760a6/2c20d0e9-ad0c-4502-b3c6-59e8e8015cd8_1194461_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=20831814bb87a67a"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/north-mississippi-allstars-with-uncle-jesse-dj-set-08-31-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-01T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"North Mississippi Allstars (with Uncle Jesse DJ Set)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"North Mississippi AllstarsDOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, July 14th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.

Kellersalbums reflect his pursuit to create music that sounds like nothing else. Un-beholden to conventionalism, heseamlessly crossesgenre boundaries. The end product is music that encompasses rock, jazz, funk andbluegrass, and always keeps the audience on their feet. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging liveperformances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage showsare rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself onacoustic guitar, bass, guitar synthesizer and drum samples; a technique called live phrase sampling orlooping.The end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica, a genreKeller jokingly calls acoustic dance music or ADM. Kellers constant evolution has led to numerous bandprojects as well;Keller McCourys, GratefulGospel and More Than A Little to name a few. Keller can be found playing clubs and festivals around the U.S.with these projects throughout the year","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cb8fff67900058e4e45a1e882276c916/72b5ec52/78bf528c-8fbd-43c5-8cb4-f0416144dec9_1110711_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=12f71a658f11ab40"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-band-of-heathens-with-sturtz-09-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-11T23:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Band of Heathens (with Sturtz)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"The Band of HeathensDOORS OPEN: 4:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, July 28th - 10:00amVIP TICKETS: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the VIP section.

Every Tuesday night, the five-piece group came together via Zoom from theirrespective homesfrom L.A. to Asheville-to host theGood Time Supper Club, a ninety-minutevariety program.It was nice to be able to use music as a connective thread and something thats healing, says guitarist-vocalist Ed Jurdi. We were doing itfor ourselves, but the greatest benefit was how it created thiscommunity for us to hang out with our fans.Guitarist-vocalist and fellow founding member Gordy Quist agrees. The show was like a release,where we all connected and forgot about the stuffgoing on around us. At some point, we decided tobring in guests for an interview, and that turned into Hey, lets pre-record a music video of a cover songwith each of them.That segment of the show, calledRemote Transmissions, became a much-anticipated fan favorite eachweek. And it is now the title of their latest album, featuring covers of ten classic songs with guestvocals by the likes of Margo Price, Ray Wylie Hubbard and Charlie Starr.Its just the latest innovative move for The Band Of Heathens, who over the last fifteen years havereleased nine acclaimed albums of roots rock originals, played festivals like Bonnaroo and South bySouthwest, and toured the world many times over (Rolling Stonecalls them a smoking live band), allwhile remaining that rarest of birdsa truly independent group","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/65f6bc586e294391113b373c0f04e641/7c7459e7/5152f628-8b52-4bf0-833d-89075f70fbe0_284001_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1656785649&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1d7e5278c2ebd4ff"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/jd-mc-pherson-with-the-patient-zeros-09-17-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-18T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"JD McPherson (with The Patient Zeros)","Subtitle":null,"Description":"JD McPherson (with The Patient Zeros)DOORS OPEN: TIMEMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, May 5th - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, May 6th - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, August 4th - 10:00amVIP TICKETS: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the VIP section.
