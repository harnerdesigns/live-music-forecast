The ever-shifting repertoire draws from homegrown idioms steeped in traditional Americana, folk, blues, jazz, and rock and roll, with a healthy dose of the avant-garde. Dig deeper into the songs, their storylines, and the characters inhabiting them, and youll find enduring tales of murder and intrigue, gamblers and thieves, sinners and saints, tales of everyman, mythic and surreal, blue-collar rhapsodies in a kaleidoscopic tapestry awash in color, sound, and light.Shakedown Streets own story finds them continuing to play to enthusiastic sold-out audiences, while marching up and down, going around and around their beloved home in the mountains of Colorado. The band happily finds itself in the trusted role of connecting past, present and future Grateful Dead fans with the vital and vibrant energies of improvisational live music. Endlessly fun, exciting, dramatic, uplifting, inspirational. The band and audience in concert. A reset for the soul!","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-02-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656522248&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b13f7ad6037d4651"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt
