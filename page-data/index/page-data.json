The ever-shifting repertoire draws from homegrown idioms steeped in traditional Americana, folk, blues, jazz, and rock and roll, with a healthy dose of the avant-garde. Dig deeper into the songs, their storylines, and the characters inhabiting them, and youll find enduring tales of murder and intrigue, gamblers and thieves, sinners and saints, tales of everyman, mythic and surreal, blue-collar rhapsodies in a kaleidoscopic tapestry awash in color, sound, and light.Shakedown Streets own story finds them continuing to play to enthusiastic sold-out audiences, while marching up and down, going around and around their beloved home in the mountains of Colorado. The band happily finds itself in the trusted role of connecting past, present and future Grateful Dead fans with the vital and vibrant energies of improvisational live music. Endlessly fun, exciting, dramatic, uplifting, inspirational. The band and audience in concert. A reset for the soul!","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/shakedown-street-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11890995","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261010&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=002ba3bb9dd75724"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt

The Altons, natives of the region, combine dust kicked up from backyard parties with evening Art Laboe listening sessions, evoking a sound that veers far from the shadows. The Altons curate a ballad of retro-indie-soul that has captivated local audiences for several years, quickly driving them to become a staple of the scene. Their distinct sound caught the attention of Daptone Records Co-founder Gabe Roth, who was in the process of starting Penrose Records. Penrose became a subsidiary label to Daptone to highlight the emerging soul-scene growing in Southern California, where The Altons fit perfectly.Their Penrose debut When You Go (Thats When Youll Know) was KCRWs Todays Top Tune, and their most recent single Tangled Up In You has been featured on Soulection Radio.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-altons-with-wes-watkins-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11869925","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/02dbacd115c6064199bed385427b349c/e45448bc/2352e3b5-8496-496b-97a3-e605177e848b_105851_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=ebb613dfc5ae2efa"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt

NPRs Bob Boilen attributes the bands allure to their Soul, straight from horn to heart. He adds, This band is on fire when its in front of an audience...but the intensity of their shows are also captured in the studio. Following The Suffers electrifying late night TV debut on Lettermanin 2015, David Letterman exclaimed, If you cant do this, get out of the business! There is something undeniable about The Suffers (whose name is a reference to the1978 Jamaican film Rockers starring Leroy Horsemouth Wallace, Jacob Miller and Burning Spear, among others), that instantly hits home with their audiences. We make music for all people, says lead vocalist Kam Franklin. At this point, weve played all over the world and one thing is certain-if the music is good, the people will enjoy it. Since 2011, the H-Town heroes have been on a steady grind and have no plans of stopping.The Suffers exploded onto the scene in 2015 with their dazzling EP Make Some Room, which was followed by their critically heralded self-titled debut in 2016. The Suffers released their latest record Everything Here on Shanachie Records July 13, 2018. Everything Here is the bands most bold statement yet. Lead Singer Kam Franklin states, Our hope is that our fans walk away feeling empowered, resilient, and inspired to live a better life.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-suffers-with-adiel-mitchell-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11960975","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5ab0e7f3156d85a6f31413ece5d1fe00/3d10fd16/2e303aae-9afa-4fff-a883-4fa94945fa13_5641_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=35938f520dab1636"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/arturo-sandoval-10-time-grammy-award-winner-07-08-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-09T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"ARTURO SANDOVAL 10 Time Grammy Award Winner","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Singer & Simpson Productions Proudly Present ARTURO SANDOVAL 10 Time Grammy Winner!

Rev. Peyton, the Big Damn Bands vocalist and world-class fingerstyle guitarist, details bleak financial challenges on the songs Ways and Means and Dirty Hustlin. He pines for in-person reunions with loved ones on No Tellin When, and he pleads for celestial relief on the album-closing Come Down Angels.Far from a depressing listen, Dance Songs lives up to its name by delivering action-packed riffs and rhythms across 11 songs. The country blues trio that won over crowds on more than one Warped Tour knows how to make an audience move.I like songs that sound happy but are actually very sad, Peyton says. I dont know why it is, but I just do.Of course, the greatest front-porch blues band in the world found itself sidelined from a relentless touring schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic. Peyton says he was surprised when his mind and soul unleashed a batch of new songs in March and April of 2020.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11869975","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/017fa79dfe4190af0bac62403cab07a0/de9a8256/32bd8764-1ed9-4881-9067-11c26a515186_880511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4d79caf44db73edb"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt

Emerging out of Austin, Texas, Person plays loud, raw, and connects with his music fans on a primal sonic level. Only 25 years old, Person has a swagger, talent and grit beyond his years. With the poise of a seasoned veteran on stage and the stylings of a mega star, he commands an audience in seconds.Reminiscent of everyone from Elmore James and Duane Allman to The Black Keys and Jack White, Person channels a raw, pure-bred American swagger, said American Songwriter. Between the driving beat, Persons fuzzed-out vocals and the layers of bombastic guitar parts, the tune shows off all the reasons that Buddy Guy once said of Person What else can I say? The young man is hot!His inspirations are varied, and include prolific artists like The Black Keys, Jack White, Chris Stapleton, Jonny Lang, Funkadelic, and Led Zeppelin. With his new project, Zach has created his own take on a contemporary hybrid of blues and rock music, arranged in a pop format.Persons self-titled, debut LP dropped on April 2, 2021 and garnered the attention of notable press including American Songwriter, Classic Rock Magazine, American Blues Scene, Guitar World, Premier Guitar, Mojo Magazine, Lyric Magazine, Mercury Magazine, and more.The overall success of his LP, has led to additional collaborations with international brands like, Amazon, Kendra Scott, ACL Live, Soho House, Kimpton & Fairmont Hotels, and BMI.Zach is currently on tour in North America, and is scheduled to tour Europe and the U.K. this fall (2022).

They began touring as a family band, boarding a 1956 tour bus (once belonging to Bill Monroe, Kitty Wells, and Ernest Tubb) and headed south from Ohio to Tennessee. At age 11, Mayfield began playing guitar and writing songs.At age 15, Mayfield recorded her first album White Lies under the moniker Chittlin, printing only a few hundred copies. One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. After an introduction, Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio, laying the foundation of her debut album With Blasphemy So Heartfelt. Pitchfork Media gave the record a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Online magazine Blurt named the record the Best Album of 2008 and gave Mayfield the title of Best New Artist of 2008.Her latest record, Sorry is Gone was released in 2017 and detailed her years of quietly enduring domestic abuse by her then-husband.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/jessica-lea-mayfield-with-despair-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11870415","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1c6798f0f6db2a64f893fcbc8a13ff18/7fe2a3f5/1cae9108-6a98-4696-9f32-b075d16e90fc_619361_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b1673baaef1079e4"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/show-me-the-body-soul-glo-wifigawd-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Show Me the Body, Soul Glo, Wifigawd","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/show-me-the-body-soul-black-sheep-tickets/12182725?REFERRAL_ID=tmfeed","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/16ebcad49e258bfddff5d1bca8d83b9c/c6a7f1ed/453f7656-9a18-406f-8df9-abf159b34c9b_1550801_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1f4f7f229e72d867"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/black-sheep"},"data":{"Name":"Black Sheep","City":"Colorado Springs"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/cowboy-junkies-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-07-15T01:00:00.000Z","Name":"Cowboy Junkies","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/cowboy-junkies-grand-junction-colorado-07-14-2022/event/1E005C81C098304E","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8ef111bc8cdb6724bcc01499c152fb2d/372b2b2c/20d1c70c-a312-4281-b8fb-5ea4fff74fdb_1449941_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261012&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=378738eaf5fed60e"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/avalon-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Avalon Theatre","City":"Grand Junction"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/we-are-william-dimension-knife-in-hand-when-darkness-falls-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"We Are William, Dimension, Knife In Hand, When Darkness Falls","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Formed in 2017, We Are William is a progressive metal band out of Northern Colorado.

Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/triston-marez-high-country-hustle-vultures-tickets/12198825","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4b0a2651b9fb56d1dc79845360afc858/2b7e021e/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=9b80b4c18ac52f62"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/vultures"},"data":{"Name":"Vultures","City":null}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/we-are-william-intrinsic-gray-dimensions-07-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"We Are William, Intrinsic Gray, Dimensions","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Formed in 2017, We Are William is a progressive metal band out of Northern Colorado.

Just in time to celebrate our 25th birthday. The band had just released its 12th studio album in January 2020. The Unraveling was mostly recorded in Memphis at Sam Phillips Recording Service nine new songs detailing the horrific state of MAGA America in songs that addressed white supremacy, school shootings and the opioid crisis. The album earned excellent reviews (including later being named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone in France) and we set out on the road playing shows up the east coast including NYC, Boston and DC. Unfortunately, the pandemic happened and we only completed one three-week leg of what was supposed to be a 15-month tour. In lockdown, we all did what we could.

Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.

The latest album, Ready Coat came into existence after the decision to add a touring member enabled the band to expand its sonic ability. This opportunity to stretch the bands sound and add elements which would have previously been impossible to play live, enabled them to self-produce, engineer, and mix a record without considering limitations. There are absolutely no words to express the bandʼs anticipation and excitement for finally being able to play these new songs (as well as many, many others) live on tour.

Jones","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Over the course of three full-length albums and two EPs, Jonathon Robert Linaberry has woven his own tapestry of American roots music. Its a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012s The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether its a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above. The records essence was shaped by those beautiful desert nights and the roads that go on endlessly, says J.R. A Celebrations cover art with its western color palette, desert iconography, and black-and-white photograph of wild animals was handmade by J.R., who also created a series of accompanying prints. A Celebration does more than shine a light on the American southwest it highlights J.R.s ability to the bridge the gap between artistic disciplines.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-bones-of-jr-jones-the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-tickets/12110655","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261012&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6ef68d4fbcf7bee3"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/missio-07-21-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-22T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Missio","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 8:00 PM Show 9:00 PM THIS SHOW IS ALL AGES All support acts and times subject to change","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://concerts.livenation.com/missio-denver-colorado-07-21-2022/event/1E005CBAB6F6464F","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e0503911c86d25c49db49b7777d208b8/e4616c5a/ba96127f-846c-488a-b32c-ce20ad8c2e53_1715771_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0726dd5e2e8e4a0e"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/marquis-theater"},"data":{"Name":"Marquis Theater","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/david-gray-07-21-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-22T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":"2022-07-22T05:00:00.000Z","DoorsTime":null,"Name":"David Gray","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1Ad7EOM","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ed706a598503e3d4a3457d4dc777324d/f5a88a7d/8920da0b-cc52-4d81-9a89-35e0bb84392d_888121_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d4d255092fb7c75b"}],"Artist_Genres":["Neo Mellow"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/ghost-of-paul-revere-07-21-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-22T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Ghost of Paul Revere","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1Adfv_S","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d86d2bea046102ddad8143f077429d22/1883efd8/1318210f-9f83-4d84-9c47-bedaaff71a2d_1587011_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg?ts=1657261010&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=88a4eb88f6dad232"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mesa-theatre-club"},"data":{"Name":"Mesa Theatre & Club","City":null}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-lumineers-brightside-world-tour-07-22-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-23T00:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Lumineers -

Jones","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Over the course of three full-length albums and two EPs, Jonathon Robert Linaberry has woven his own tapestry of American roots music. Its a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012s The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether its a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above. The records essence was shaped by those beautiful desert nights and the roads that go on endlessly, says J.R. A Celebrations cover art with its western color palette, desert iconography, and black-and-white photograph of wild animals was handmade by J.R., who also created a series of accompanying prints.

Their solo efforts hailed by Record Crates United as psychedelic down to its very DNA and the definition of cosmic music respectively, childhood friends Adams and Dooley moved to Denver in 2017, where they met locals Sparks and Somerville. Combining their loves for deep-end psych and emo-hardcore, Totem Pocket creates music that swerves between atmoshpheric tranquility and total sonic warfare.

the punked-up blues of R.L. Burnside, the storytelling of Bobby Blue Bland, and the soulfully layered horns of the Stones. No one sound holds more weight than the next; all are all omnipresent throughout. The Difference Between Me s fifth studio album. And while its an approach that might veer slightly from the typical sounds those whove followed the band are used to hearing, it was a conscious step in a new direction for Lewis. When asked, Lewis says he wanted to make a more complex and reflective record than he had before.

A few years later Fela Kuti came calling. Kaleta would go on to tour the world playing guitar for the King of Afrobeat in his storied band Egypt 80 through the 1980s and into the 1990s.Now based in New York City, Kaleta has been leading Super Yamba Band since 2017. Their debut album Mdaho, which was released by California indie label Ubiquity Records, draws on the groups shared reverence for the raw, psychedelic sounds that captivated Kaleta as a music loving kid in 1970s Benin. Mdaho means big brother, elder or teacher and is dedicated to Kaletas late brother Ligan-Ozavino Pascal who introduced him to funk and soul music at a very early age. The album was included on Bandcamps Best Albums of Summer 2019 list and two of the songs were chosen for the ABC/Hulu series High Fidelity staring Zoe Kravitz.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/kaleta-super-yamba-band-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11870775","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f742b229f132ac55c9c8c96b36279cdd/084e1ba6/5fefbd1c-973b-4b0e-9b2e-d78e4ce37548_106111_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261010&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=2ae654e5546cbef8"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt

Learn more at allianceformusicedequity.org.Y La BambaY La Bamba has been many things, but at the heart of it is singer-songwriter Luz Elena Mendozas inquisitive sense of self. Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based bands affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPRs Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendozas artistic voice like never before. Soy como soy, Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold even political statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bambas most unbridled offering yet.Mujeres was recorded by Luz Elena Mendoza and Ryan Oxford at Color Therapy Studios and Besitos Fritos Studios in Portland, Oregon. Mixed by Jeff Bond, with Grace Bugbee on bass, John Niekrasz on drums, Margaret Wher Gibson on keys, and Ed Rodriguez and Ryan Oxford on electric guitar.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/y-la-bamba-with-kayla-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11966415","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261012&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6ef68d4fbcf7bee3"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt

Voted Kansas Citys Best Musician 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 (PitchKC), and featured on Billboard.com, NPR.org, NEWNOWNEXT, Pride.com, and GRAMMY.com, Arsenias angelic stylings on voice and harp create rare harmonies and arrangements that look past the boundaries of his traditional gospel and classical upbringing. Known for his elaborate and ceremonious sensory concert experiences that merge jazz and electronic influences, Calvin has consistently deliver(s) genre-bending (and gender-bending) shows that tackle sexuality, religion, and race in a stunningly unorthodox manner - somewhere between sacred and sacrilege. A healthy serving of indie rock, neo-soul, R&B, and a splash of art pop, this multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter is a shimmering force to be reckoned with. Jeff Buckley meets Nina Simone with this soul of Sam Cooke, and the sparkle of Bjork. The music is just one part of his prodigious performances, for Calvin believes the art is in crafting the perfect moment. His music is best served live, with sensational performances and high fashion from the visually striking performer who stands at 66. Arsenias height, energy, and curated environments fill the often intimate spaces he performs in. Brought into 9 countries through public and private grants in less than a decade, Arsenia builds a scene for his audience and for himself, packed with beauty and lasting delight.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/calvin-arsenia-with-nina-de-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11867455","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4b0a2651b9fb56d1dc79845360afc858/2b7e021e/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=9b80b4c18ac52f62"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-keys-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Alicia Keys","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1AdAxf9","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ad72075c31bee93cdbee19912ffb3107/304180ad/fe18a6d9-7359-4621-a145-7b0ec8cc8db4_1672261_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1c47633565e5ea4d"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bellco Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-the-world-tour-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"ALICIA The World Tour","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.axs.com/events/390799/alicia-keys-tickets","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c2c4a3adcfefb3d20d9f30f6f4c57f0/6deabf13/c941c0bf-6b68-4739-8324-85b8edbe18d1_1435671_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=baafd20873a496e3"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bellco Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/1964-the-tribute-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"1964 the Tribute","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1Adux7e","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ce5f770894ae65373f65dd1549b7c6c6/6f472b9a/ec5d2659-359c-4829-97cd-032be6d1a3d3_19191_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_3_2.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=487754598743f456"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-keys-vip-packages-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Alicia Keys - VIP Packages","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://livemu.sc/AliciaKeys-VIP","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c2c4a3adcfefb3d20d9f30f6f4c57f0/6deabf13/c941c0bf-6b68-4739-8324-85b8edbe18d1_1435671_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=baafd20873a496e3"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bellco Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/santa-fe-klan-mar-y-tierra-tour-2022-08-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Santa Fe Klan - Mar y Tierra Tour 2022","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Ages 16+ welcome with valid photo ID.

Still promoting his first full-length album, Livers and Diers, Yancey has laid the foundation for a long career as a songwriter. Jesh began playing and writing music in 2002 and has been crafting his sound ever since. After failing out of college the first time and running off to join the Navy, Yancey found himself on the Gulf Coast with a pen in his hand and something to say where the majority of the songs for Livers and Diers emerged. With influences like John Prine, Guy Clark, Todd Snider and Widespread Panic, Jesh has established a catalogue of songs with a solid groove and an honest sentiment that takes a couple listens to fully take in. Livers and Diers is a journey from the darkest depths of ignorance to the blinding truths of everyday life and is an attempt to jolt the listener into deeper thought while their toe starts tapping. Jesh grew up in rural northeast Alabama and was raised by a cowboy and an English teacher which is where he found his way with words and a working-mans point of view that contributes to his fearless, gritty, no-frills style. Yancey pens songs that highlight the challenges in society while leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions. Jesh found The High Hopes in the fall of 2018 in Mobile, Alabama and theyve been playing everywhere that will have them ever since. The High Hopes have had several lineup changes since Yancey moved from Mobile but the foundation is still firmly rooted in a type of American Music Yancey refers to as PsycheDeltaFolk that allow Jesh to carry the listener through each song in any direction. One set might consist of heady jams while the next set grooves the country blues all while being original music. Jesh and his wife, Miranda, moved to the city of Denver, Colorado in July 2019 to establish roots in the rich Colorado music scene. Catch Jesh hustlin through the city lookin for a gig and something that rhymes!","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/jesh-yancey-the-high-the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-tickets/12153995","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7ad8db1612345d42d2d8f56cf9e8d7d3/a4f3ad69/c58dd0af-cda8-49b2-bdaf-068540c3a677_106541_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=54734532aa766c0e"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/gimme-gimme-disco-08-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Gimme Gimme Disco","Subtitle":null,"Description":"DOORS: 8:00 PM SHOW: 8:00 PM THIS SHOW IS: 21 AND OVER","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://concerts.livenation.com/gimme-gimme-disco-denver-colorado-08-26-2022/event/1E005CD1C0126068","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f7f0e2d080b756ce97377b8611fb702a/edc446c0/774748cd-480c-4a84-8547-b28ab48ca2b7_1240671_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4064b4a8229f84d0"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/summit"},"data":{"Name":"Summit","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/amanda-miguel-ana-victoria-verdaguer-siempre-te-amare-08-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T02:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Amanda Miguel & Ana Victoria Verdaguer: SIEMPRE TE AMARE","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/amanda-miguel-ana-victoria-verdaguer-siempre-denver-colorado-08-26-2022/event/1E005B64870D1547","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b38d32ef5e2156f513d9fb1196d99d5d/5bf6de52/5fefbd1c-973b-4b0e-9b2e-d78e4ce37548_106111_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261010&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b595c26a984ce8e1"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Paramount Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/anjunadeep-08-27-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T21:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Anjunadeep","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1AdfdGM","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/677d0c0c9d8686958dd4092d39801382/dcfeb6ac/8979fcff-30a3-49b4-9064-86244aacfb43_1673841_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_3_2.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=377b95c8b6300e2d"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alice-in-chains-w-breaking-benjamin-08-27-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T23:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Alice in Chains w/ Breaking Benjamin","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1Ad89Z4","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8550c373c23722b19cab23f79f7b2656/5a335686/75050142-a7dd-49b5-a70a-0c035a2fc32a_1630561_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=edfab9bdaf8414bd"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/fiddlers-green-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/kid-cudi-to-the-moon-08-27-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-28T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","Name":"Kid Cudi - To The Moon","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Ball Arena will continue to monitor local COVID-19 trends.

Kellersalbums reflect his pursuit to create music that sounds like nothing else. Un-beholden to conventionalism, heseamlessly crossesgenre boundaries. The end product is music that encompasses rock, jazz, funk andbluegrass, and always keeps the audience on their feet. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging liveperformances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage showsare rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself onacoustic guitar, bass, guitar synthesizer and drum samples; a technique called live phrase sampling orlooping.The end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica, a genreKeller jokingly calls acoustic dance music or ADM. Kellers constant evolution has led to numerous bandprojects as well;Keller McCourys, GratefulGospel and More Than A Little to name a few. Keller can be found playing clubs and festivals around the U.S.with these projects throughout the year","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/keller-williams-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11961235","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cb8fff67900058e4e45a1e882276c916/72b5ec52/78bf528c-8fbd-43c5-8cb4-f0416144dec9_1110711_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d00fcd8aaafc775e"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/brandi-carlile-09-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-10T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Brandi Carlile","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1Ad19ZM","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f27e84294b3e69ec809c4880b80fa56f/f0b48281/ef0e7340-05af-4a39-ae32-9a11a806f3ab_1480081_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cd7342e4e0b3cd64"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/weird-al-yankovic-09-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-10T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Weird Al Yankovic","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1AdGyjE","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7cabebef7e1e7e5149dfaf2d07a419b5/28c77752/1a5a6417-5a9b-4dd1-ac1e-8aa162fb91e8_1572181_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d9857443b65af313"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/monfort-concert-hall"},"data":{"Name":"Monfort Concert Hall","City":"Greeley"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/dave-matthews-band-09-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-10T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Dave Matthews Band","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1AdCvjF","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ff101afdf35ab0ec5b3c5f9155720e79/7146337f/3e9eb30d-09ed-42fa-973d-a074fa0263e1_1603631_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261010&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=168187ca2ff56594"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/fiddlers-green-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/munly-the-lupercalians-09-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-10T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Munly & The Lupercalians","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1AdoI0o","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7830ceee66c955998fa7d19b0edae2c2/15639fa1/c5c08e7a-9912-456c-a060-2758be94e060_105881_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=5899ee1e453e17da"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bluebird Theatre","City":null}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/hanson-red-green-blue-2022-tour-09-09-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-10T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-09-10T01:00:00.000Z","Name":"Hanson -

Every Tuesday night, the five-piece group came together via Zoom from theirrespective homesfrom L.A. to Asheville-to host theGood Time Supper Club, a ninety-minutevariety program.It was nice to be able to use music as a connective thread and something thats healing, says guitarist-vocalist Ed Jurdi. We were doing itfor ourselves, but the greatest benefit was how it created thiscommunity for us to hang out with our fans.Guitarist-vocalist and fellow founding member Gordy Quist agrees. The show was like a release,where we all connected and forgot about the stuffgoing on around us. At some point, we decided tobring in guests for an interview, and that turned into Hey, lets pre-record a music video of a cover songwith each of them.That segment of the show, calledRemote Transmissions, became a much-anticipated fan favorite eachweek. And it is now the title of their latest album, featuring covers of ten classic songs with guestvocals by the likes of Margo Price, Ray Wylie Hubbard and Charlie Starr.Its just the latest innovative move for The Band Of Heathens, who over the last fifteen years havereleased nine acclaimed albums of roots rock originals, played festivals like Bonnaroo and South bySouthwest, and toured the world many times over (Rolling Stonecalls them a smoking live band), allwhile remaining that rarest of birdsa truly independent group","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"TicketURL":"https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-band-of-heathens-with-levitt-pavilion-denver-tickets/11961255","SoldOut":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/65f6bc586e294391113b373c0f04e641/7c7459e7/5152f628-8b52-4bf0-833d-89075f70fbe0_284001_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1657261011&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0e29a2648d1dadd0"}],"Artist_Genres":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/american-full-moon-30-years-of-moonspell-09-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-12T00:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"American Full Moon: 30 Years of Moonspell","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 6:30 PM Show 7:30 PM THIS SHOW IS ALL AGES All support acts and times subject to change Based on the latest local guidelines, attendees are no longer required to provide proof of negative COVID-19 test AND/OR vaccination for entry into this event.
