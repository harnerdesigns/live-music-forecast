Between the driving beat, Persons fuzzed-out vocals and the layers of bombastic guitar parts, the tune shows off all the reasons that Buddy Guy once said of Person What else can I say? The young man is hot!His inspirations are varied, and include prolific artists like The Black Keys, Jack White, Chris Stapleton, Jonny Lang, Funkadelic, and Led Zeppelin. With his new project, Zach has created his own take on a contemporary hybrid of blues and rock music, arranged in a pop format.Persons self-titled, debut LP dropped on April 2, 2021 and garnered the attention of notable press including American Songwriter, Classic Rock Magazine, American Blues Scene, Guitar World, Premier Guitar, Mojo Magazine, Lyric Magazine, Mercury Magazine, and more.The overall success of his LP, has led to additional collaborations with international brands like, Amazon, Kendra Scott, ACL Live, Soho House, Kimpton & Fairmont Hotels, and BMI.Zach is currently on tour in North America, and is scheduled to tour Europe and the U.K. this fall (2022).
