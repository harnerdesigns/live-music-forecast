If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\n<H2> BTTRFLY QUINTET </H2>\n\nBTTRFLY QUINTET is the newly formed project of; Eric \"Benny\" Bloom (Lettuce), Dominc Lalli (Big Gigantic), Adam Deitch (Lettuce), Borahm Lee (Break Science/PL Live Band) and Hunter Roberts (Break Science Live). A group of highly regarded musicians across America and the world that reside in Denver who bonded together during the 2020 pandemic to create music that satisfied their love for adventurous, improvisational futuristic soul jazz.\n\nIndividually, the members of the quintet have won Grammy’s, garnered multiple Grammy nominations, charted billboard on several occasions, collaborated on platinum records, played some of the top festivals and venues in North America, as well as performed across the planet.\n\nThe QUINTET will be coming together officially for the first time for their Meow Wolf performance before making their festival debut at Florida’s Brainquility Festival. The group has further grabbed fans attention by prefacing they have an album to be released in 2022\n\n<H3> Dandu </H3> \n\nDandu’s music is hard to categorize, with ever-expanding influences that range from jazz to metal, electronica to classical, and beyond. The trio’s sound is fueled by complex, well thought out arrangements that leave room for moments of true spontaneity. The mission of the music is to take you on a journey through shifting scenes, evoke a range of emotion, and keep you endlessly surprised by what comes next. The sound of this democratic outfit is made up of the deep pocket and melodic style of bassist Sean Dandurand, the masterfully polyrhythmic and endlessly modulating grooves of drummer Dylan Johnson, and the vast textures and swirling soundscapes of synthesist/keyboardist Ben Weirich. Dandu has played across the US, at iconic venues like Webster Hall, Chautauqua Auditorium, Paradise Rock Club, and more. The trio has shared the stage with Thundercat, Jacob Collier, Louis Cole, John Scofield, John Medeski, Victor Wooten, Tera Melos, and many more.

The Parisian duo rose to global prominence eliciting a summery musical hedonism that flicks like frames through Golden Era Hollywood films &mdash; think romance-thrillers in Saint Tropez or love-crossed youth in Rio de Janeiro. With the release of their long-awaited sophomore LP&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>, Polo &amp; Pan further refine their cinematic impressions on house, disco, club, techno, and psychedelia in arrangements that play out like vignettes, abstractions on the motif of voyage that traverse through locales, time, tempo, and the cycles of life.\r\n<div><em><br />Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;is Polo &amp; Pan fully realized: hedonism matured, sounds fine-tuned, scope broadened. While standouts like &ldquo;Feel Good&rdquo; and the ELO-inspired &ldquo;Magic&rdquo; are cued up to soundtrack the world&rsquo;s revelers emerging again into a joyful daylight world, Polo &amp; Pan are also exploring shades of darkness and introspection. &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jiminy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo; &mdash; the latter a collaboration with the Compton-bred club iconoclast Channel Tres &mdash; take the duo&rsquo;s sonic late into the realm of all-night sessions, awash with brooding mystique.&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;also finds Polo &amp; Pan foraying to the fringes of dancefloor thematics, exploring life, death, and transcendence in tracks like the buoyant and celebratory &ldquo;Ani Kuni&rdquo; and the wistful psychedelic ballad &lsquo;Melody.&rsquo;<br /><br />\r\n<div>Throughout the&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;journey, Polo &amp; Pan offer richer textures, more complex emotions, intrepid collaborations, and surprises like the emergence of Paul Armand-Delille&rsquo;s dulcet vocals. The album closer &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo; is a promise that, although Polo &amp; Pan may have matured, they&rsquo;ll never quite grow up so much that they lose their joyous touch. So while&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama&nbsp;</em>may be a watershed in the scope of the duo&rsquo;s sound, the feeling the music brings to the dancefloor remains uncompromisingly, inimitably, and undoubtedly Polo &amp; Pan.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/polo-pan"},"data":{"Name":"Polo & Pan"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c5dd3d6a884804c329a7012549b0ee4/e87e281a/polo-pan-tickets_02-10-22_18_60b7e43621ffd.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/polo-and-pan-02-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-11T03:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Polo and Pan","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2fcb069bb29d257c9e129000b98c823e/65391e83/7ae04ac0-7020-4586-8769-fd95cdcadf69_1443931_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_3_2.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/tommy-trash-at-transform-02-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-11T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Tommy Trash at Transform","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-10-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9a8dc6cbaa4457b6dee17fc975537d7/f8a52d4a/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Temple Nightclub"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/temple-nightclub"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Temple Nightclub"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"02-10-2022","today":"2022-02-05T18:10:24.737Z","slug":"02-10"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
