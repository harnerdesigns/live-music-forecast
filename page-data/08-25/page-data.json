Voted Kansas Citys Best Musician 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 (PitchKC), and featured on Billboard.com, NPR.org, NEWNOWNEXT, Pride.com, and GRAMMY.com, Arsenias angelic stylings on voice and harp create rare harmonies and arrangements that look past the boundaries of his traditional gospel and classical upbringing. Known for his elaborate and ceremonious sensory concert experiences that merge jazz and electronic influences, Calvin has consistently deliver(s) genre-bending (and gender-bending) shows that tackle sexuality, religion, and race in a stunningly unorthodox manner - somewhere between sacred and sacrilege. A healthy serving of indie rock, neo-soul, R&B, and a splash of art pop, this multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter is a shimmering force to be reckoned with. Jeff Buckley meets Nina Simone with this soul of Sam Cooke, and the sparkle of Bjork. The music is just one part of his prodigious performances, for Calvin believes the art is in crafting the perfect moment. His music is best served live, with sensational performances and high fashion from the visually striking performer who stands at 66. Arsenias height, energy, and curated environments fill the often intimate spaces he performs in. Brought into 9 countries through public and private grants in less than a decade, Arsenia builds a scene for his audience and for himself, packed with beauty and lasting delight.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-25-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4b0a2651b9fb56d1dc79845360afc858/2b7e021e/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=c00353b1fbf4bfa6"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-keys-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Alicia Keys","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-25-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/alicia-keys"},"data":{"Name":"Alicia Keys"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ad72075c31bee93cdbee19912ffb3107/304180ad/fe18a6d9-7359-4621-a145-7b0ec8cc8db4_1672261_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526751&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0902b03aed775e46"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Bellco Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Bellco Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-the-world-tour-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"ALICIA The World Tour","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-25-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c2c4a3adcfefb3d20d9f30f6f4c57f0/6deabf13/c941c0bf-6b68-4739-8324-85b8edbe18d1_1435671_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526750&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0980e43d421fc239"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Bellco Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Bellco Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/1964-the-tribute-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"1964 the Tribute","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-25-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/1964-the-tribute"},"data":{"Name":"1964 The Tribute"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ce5f770894ae65373f65dd1549b7c6c6/6f472b9a/ec5d2659-359c-4829-97cd-032be6d1a3d3_19191_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_3_2.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=f08312da5196a684"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Red Rocks Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/alicia-keys-vip-packages-08-25-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-26T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Alicia Keys - VIP Packages","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-25-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/alicia-keys"},"data":{"Name":"Alicia Keys"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c2c4a3adcfefb3d20d9f30f6f4c57f0/6deabf13/c941c0bf-6b68-4739-8324-85b8edbe18d1_1435671_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=95322c911246149d"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Bellco Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bellco-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Bellco Theatre"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"08-25-2022","today":"2022-06-29T18:19:26.476Z","slug":"08-25"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
