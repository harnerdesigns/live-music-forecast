Right now, the Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter is riding a creative tidal wave, firing out acclaimed albums, hooking up with the biggest names in music and rocking the house each night with that celebrated burnt-honey voice. In 2016, the headline news is Beth&rsquo;s latest album, Fire On The Floor (out 14 October 2016 (Europe / Australia / New Zealand) and 3 February 2017 (US / Canada) on Provogue/Mascot Label Group): a release that even this fiercely self-critical artist describes as &ldquo;pretty frickin&rsquo; good&rdquo;. But let&rsquo;s not forget the backstory that brought her here&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>The Blues Magazine once dubbed Beth Hart &ldquo;the ultimate female rock star&rdquo;, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that her two-decade career is the ultimate thrill-ride. Born in Los Angeles, she released a fistful of hit albums through the &rsquo;90s, then reignited in the post-millennium as both a solo artist and the head-turning vocalist for guitar heroes like Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and Slash. &ldquo;Extraordinary,&rdquo; wrote The Times of her once-a-generation voicebox, while The Guardian praised her &ldquo;daring, brooding and angry&rdquo; performances. It&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s been nominated for three Blues Music Awards.</p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s in recent times that Beth has truly blossomed. In April 2015, she released Better Than Home: a critical and commercial smash that topped the iTunes Blues Chart and was crowned #4 Best Blues Album Of The Year by Mojo magazine. The release led her to fill Amsterdam&rsquo;s Heineken Music Hall with 5,500 fans (her largest club show to date). &ldquo;Oh, that was so good, man,&rdquo; she reflects. &ldquo;I love Holland. They&rsquo;ve been really good to me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The US has embraced her, too, packing ever-larger venues in major cities on the Better Than Home tour &ndash; including Nashville&rsquo;s iconic Ryman Auditorium &ndash; and receiving a nomination from the American Blues Foundation in the category of Contemporary Blues Female Artist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;This last tour, we were playing much bigger houses than I&rsquo;d ever played in the States &ndash; and they were sold-out.&rdquo; Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Beth&rsquo;s rocketing UK profile has never been higher. Recent years have seen auspicious headline sets at the Royal Albert Hall and the Barbican (not to mention the historic Hampton Court Palace with Joe Bonamassa), and in December 2015, she chalked up another first with a spot on Jools Holland&rsquo;s legendary annual Hootenanny.</p>\r\n<p>Bringing in the New Year with a soulful take on Tell Her You Belong To Me and Nutbush City Limits alongside long-time collaborator Jeff Beck, it spoke volumes that the pair&rsquo;s performance rapidly became the Hootenanny&rsquo;s most-watched clip on the BBC&rsquo;s official YouTube channel (even overtaking heavyweights like Tom Jones and Paul Weller). &ldquo;Every time Jeff performs, he just kills it,&rdquo; gushes Beth, who also joins the veteran guitarist for her first-ever appearance at the Hollywood Bowl this year. &ldquo;To me, he&rsquo;s the greatest ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Just as memorable, also last December, was Beth&rsquo;s first solo gig at London&rsquo;s Union Chapel (subsequently voted by fans as the venue&rsquo;s gig of the year). &ldquo;It was the most terrifying experience of my entire life,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I got up there and I was so frickin&rsquo; scared. But then, halfway through the show, I just started to enjoy it. By the end, I felt so connected to the audience, and I really felt like they did that show with me. It was like we were all the band.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fire On The Floor is sure to build on her breakneck momentum. The record gave her an emotional release following the bitter-sweet sessions for Better Than Home. Fire On The Floor is the album that Beth Hart needed to make. Likewise, it&rsquo;s a record that you need to hear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased with it,&rdquo; she concludes. &ldquo;I recently had to organise the sequence of the record, and while I was doing that, I was thinking to myself, &lsquo;Y&rsquo;know, this is pretty frickin&rsquo; good&hellip;!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Beth Hart is going on an extensive tour that will pack houses all over the world. Time and time again Beth has sold out venues in cities as New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Berlin, Milan, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Tbilisi, Sydney and Melbourne.</p>\r\n<p>But maybe her greatest live performance to date was seen by millions of television viewers, when her tribute to Buddy Guy on the Kennedy Center Honors Special received one of the only 2 standing ovations of the evening, led by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.</p>\r\n<p>Every live performance gets a standing ovation, because no one knows how to rock the house better than Beth Hart. When she sings clocks stop, hearts dance and neck-hair tingles&hellip;it&rsquo;s that compelling!</p>","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/beth-hart"},"data":{"Name":"Beth Hart"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/69e01e88b5106faed25685337e4cc908/32d61d3a/beth-hart-war-in-my-mind-tickets_02-07-22_18_6090063ab5b47.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=c25157e9fbb9df9f"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/beth-hart-02-07-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-08T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Beth Hart","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/beth-hart"},"data":{"Name":"Beth Hart"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b7927589b79f9e54390b9c68eb62d3f4/362a5250/f058d2b5-91ef-4dd2-ba55-badc3887b017_1431271_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6802397ca9e9ccf2"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/diamante-the-diamond-package-not-a-concert-ticket-02-08-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-09T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Diamante - The Diamond Package -NOT A CONCERT TICKET","Description":"Diamante The Diamond Package Includes a two song private acoustic performance from Diamante, a tour poster, and Meet & Greet.

A group of highly regarded musicians across America and the world that reside in Denver who bonded together during the 2020 pandemic to create music that satisfied their love for adventurous, improvisational futuristic soul jazz.\n\nIndividually, the members of the quintet have won Grammy’s, garnered multiple Grammy nominations, charted billboard on several occasions, collaborated on platinum records, played some of the top festivals and venues in North America, as well as performed across the planet.\n\nThe QUINTET will be coming together officially for the first time for their Meow Wolf performance before making their festival debut at Florida’s Brainquility Festival. The group has further grabbed fans attention by prefacing they have an album to be released in 2022\n\n<H3> Dandu </H3> \n\nDandu’s music is hard to categorize, with ever-expanding influences that range from jazz to metal, electronica to classical, and beyond. The trio’s sound is fueled by complex, well thought out arrangements that leave room for moments of true spontaneity. The mission of the music is to take you on a journey through shifting scenes, evoke a range of emotion, and keep you endlessly surprised by what comes next. The sound of this democratic outfit is made up of the deep pocket and melodic style of bassist Sean Dandurand, the masterfully polyrhythmic and endlessly modulating grooves of drummer Dylan Johnson, and the vast textures and swirling soundscapes of synthesist/keyboardist Ben Weirich. Dandu has played across the US, at iconic venues like Webster Hall, Chautauqua Auditorium, Paradise Rock Club, and more. The trio has shared the stage with Thundercat, Jacob Collier, Louis Cole, John Scofield, John Medeski, Victor Wooten, Tera Melos, and many more.

The Parisian duo rose to global prominence eliciting a summery musical hedonism that flicks like frames through Golden Era Hollywood films &mdash; think romance-thrillers in Saint Tropez or love-crossed youth in Rio de Janeiro. With the release of their long-awaited sophomore LP&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>, Polo &amp; Pan further refine their cinematic impressions on house, disco, club, techno, and psychedelia in arrangements that play out like vignettes, abstractions on the motif of voyage that traverse through locales, time, tempo, and the cycles of life.\r\n<div><em><br />Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;is Polo &amp; Pan fully realized: hedonism matured, sounds fine-tuned, scope broadened. While standouts like &ldquo;Feel Good&rdquo; and the ELO-inspired &ldquo;Magic&rdquo; are cued up to soundtrack the world&rsquo;s revelers emerging again into a joyful daylight world, Polo &amp; Pan are also exploring shades of darkness and introspection. &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jiminy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo; &mdash; the latter a collaboration with the Compton-bred club iconoclast Channel Tres &mdash; take the duo&rsquo;s sonic late into the realm of all-night sessions, awash with brooding mystique.&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;also finds Polo &amp; Pan foraying to the fringes of dancefloor thematics, exploring life, death, and transcendence in tracks like the buoyant and celebratory &ldquo;Ani Kuni&rdquo; and the wistful psychedelic ballad &lsquo;Melody.&rsquo;<br /><br />\r\n<div>Throughout the&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama</em>&nbsp;journey, Polo &amp; Pan offer richer textures, more complex emotions, intrepid collaborations, and surprises like the emergence of Paul Armand-Delille&rsquo;s dulcet vocals. The album closer &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo; is a promise that, although Polo &amp; Pan may have matured, they&rsquo;ll never quite grow up so much that they lose their joyous touch. So while&nbsp;<em>Cyclorama&nbsp;</em>may be a watershed in the scope of the duo&rsquo;s sound, the feeling the music brings to the dancefloor remains uncompromisingly, inimitably, and undoubtedly Polo &amp; Pan.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/polo-pan"},"data":{"Name":"Polo & Pan"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c5dd3d6a884804c329a7012549b0ee4/e87e281a/polo-pan-tickets_02-10-22_18_60b7e43621ffd.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=21835aa24803383d"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/polo-and-pan-02-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-11T03:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Polo and Pan","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2fcb069bb29d257c9e129000b98c823e/65391e83/7ae04ac0-7020-4586-8769-fd95cdcadf69_1443931_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_3_2.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=71b8b3b4f3c25019"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/tommy-trash-at-transform-02-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-11T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Tommy Trash at Transform","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9a8dc6cbaa4457b6dee17fc975537d7/f8a52d4a/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=372644a081ff4a9e"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Temple Nightclub"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/temple-nightclub"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Temple Nightclub"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/flatland-cavalry-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Flatland Cavalry","Description":"18 & older / opening act at 8:00PM","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/flatland-cavalry"},"data":{"Name":"Flatland Cavalry"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8bc99bf92cf88e528c02ca50ade901ad/c644b7d5/1be90254-19f2-434b-98bb-73100e7d6f4e_1597941_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=e0bd064955e8fa3d"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Grizzly Rose"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/grizzly-rose"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Grizzly Rose"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/flatland-cavalry-jake-worthington-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Flatland Cavalry, Jake Worthington","Description":"18 & older / opening act at 8:00PM","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/flatland-cavalry"},"data":{"Name":"Flatland Cavalry"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fcc8d974cba5d88dfef1cad259765f17/8f87179a/1be90254-19f2-434b-98bb-73100e7d6f4e_1597941_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=40dd2b6c15f3afb9"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Grizzly Rose"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/grizzly-rose"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Grizzly Rose"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/marina-ancient-dreams-in-a-modern-land-tour-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-02-12T02:00:00.000Z","Name":"Marina: Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land Tour","Description":"Ages 16+ recommended","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Dance Pop"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/marina"},"data":{"Name":"MARINA"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4c124d24598896ecbae488d0d0cec15c/166cd022/19eed05c-4936-43ed-a231-25bd8959f46b_1454331_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=a781fc64034065b0"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Paramount Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Paramount Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-burroughs-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Burroughs","Description":"Doors: 8:00 PM Show: 9:00 PM All support acts and times subject to change In the best interest of fans and staff, the Event Organizer is monitoring local COVID-19 trends and will meet or exceed protocols mandated by local governments.

Balkan Bump debuted with the single “Aymo” alongside superstar collaborators Gramatik and Talib Kweli. Gramatik quickly championed the new project; unveiling Balkan Bump's live show on his Re: Coil Tour and releasing Balkan Bump’s debut EP on his Lowtemp label imprint in 2018. Balkan Bump then blossomed to international audiences, performing at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lightning In A Bottle and Electric Forest, and releasing collaborations with CloZee, Beats Antique, The Gift Of Gab, The Geek x Vrv, Fakear, and more. Musically, Balkan Bump is a fusion of live instruments, world influences and lush electronic production. His releases flaunt experience as an instrumentalist and arranger, fusing energetic Balkan brass with heavy electronic production and hip-hop influences.\n\n<H3> ETHNO (Jeff Franca of Thievery Corporation) </H3>\n\nIntroducing ETHNO, the latest in sonic explorations from Denver based drummer/producer, Jeffrey James Franca.\n\nHeavily influenced by his love for global rhythm, ETHNO embodies the spirit and soul of Jeffrey's musical diversity. Widely known as the drummer for electronic music pioneers Thievery Corporation, Jeff brings new life, and a modern sound to the timeless experience of terrestrial vibration. You will find a vast array of influence from Africa, Asia, Caribbean and South America in the rhythms and melodies, along with lush textures and thumping bass to massage all your chakras, head to toe.\n\nListeners will feel the time that he has spent traveling the globe with Thievery Corporation, within the ethereal worldly approach that leaps forth decades to create a genuine future world music sound. ETHNO shows feature a driving mix of danceable global-electro sounds, blended with live percussion to create a unique sonic exploration that has moved crowds across the country.\n\nHaving recently collaborated with Gravitas and Westwood Recordings as a remixer, the debut EP of ETHNO is due out later this year. ETHNO truly reflects Jeffrey's philosophy on life and music. \"We are all connected, rhythmically, sonically and spiritually. Life is fun, music is fun, and we can connect people and cultures through our most joyous contribution, music. One Love\".\n","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/balkan-bump"},"data":{"Name":"Balkan Bump"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/044398d637fb6152cf312ab8e941ca79/77f7fb7f/afb3e831-e8d5-3445-8142-550e7b99f52c?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=5971a1773ea4e75c"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-wombats-02-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-15T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Wombats","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/the-wombats"},"data":{"Name":"The Wombats"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9729b31877812dcf558d937d3aaaae2e/557be73a/56893e9e-3faa-4a04-8a99-41d8efa9dc6a_1508951_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=8f7514938d574201"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Ogden Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ogden-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Ogden Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/caravan-palace-usa-and-canada-tour-2022-02-15-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-16T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Caravan Palace - USA and Canada Tour 2022","Description":"You must be 16 years old or older with a valid ID to enter the Fillmore Auditorium.

Recorded at Swingfingers Studios in Fort Collins (Colorado), the band brought a larger band than ever before, including drummer Darren Garvey of Elephant Revival, Vocalist Kim Dawson, Dobroist Todd Livingston, a horn section and more. The material reflects both the turbulent social rhythms of our current era and more timeless moments of joy, growth, and change.\n\nLike a painter that starts in acrylic and graduates to oils, Head for the Hills is deeper and richer in their 15th year as a band, with a wider palette of sonic textures at their disposal.  Dorm room jam sessions have turned into a decade plus on the road--from humble coffee shops to theaters, festivals, roadhouses and clubs all across the country. Over time those sounds and influences have crept more and more into the bluegrass beginnings of the band, morphing into the seasoned eclecticism of Say Your Mind. The new songs are quinnessential Head for the Hills; genre-stradling, lyrically deep, and danceable, with a crew of collaborators bringing the best of Colorado acoustic, roots, and soul music together. \n\nHead for the Hills numerous festival appearances include notables Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, South by Southwest, FloydFest, RockyGrass, DelFest, Summer Camp Music Festival, WinterWonderGrass Festival, Blue Ox Music Festival, Northwest String Summit, Strawberry Music Festival, Chicago Bluegrass & Blues Festival, Folk Alliance, Grandoozy and many more.

Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, mandolin, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/head-for-the-hills"},"data":{"Name":"Head for the Hills"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f4f7826330128d64d129351b04e2f461/b6b7ad96/aff4c6d0-622e-53e1-1722-e812c906b241?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1764e3ea78a0c503"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-war-on-drugs-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The War On Drugs","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Indie Rock"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/the-war-on-drugs"},"data":{"Name":"The War On Drugs"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e3f0adf1d15e3a3757425bf009bd9da7/ad638f77/f4dab1f9-4e30-4b42-8ab5-925869ebb48e_1478561_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=bdabb7f54b49263c"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/valentino-khan-at-temple-denver-02-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-19T05:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Valentino Khan at Temple Denver","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f1e812bc95800d25fe4f177038536a92/28b97e98/9d5f1b95-a2e4-4101-b469-0bc26df71806_422621_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=740b28ea4c1ef626"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Temple Nightclub"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/temple-nightclub"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Temple Nightclub"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/silvana-estrada-02-19-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-20T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Silvana Estrada","Description":"Doors 7:00 PM Show 8:00 PM All support acts and times subject to change In the best interest of fans and staff, the Event Organizer is monitoring local COVID-19 trends and will meet or exceed protocols mandated by local governments.

Split into two parts, the first section of the show sees Bruce taking a humorous and often satirical look at the world from his own very personal perspective, treating the audience to private insights into his drive and ambition, peppered with plenty of Maiden anecdotes, and a myriad of other experiences encompassing not just the giddy heights but also the extreme lows,.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b5f864614a137d3d07c1218ac72036a7/f2619665/49e5d728-8bb1-4a7a-bdbc-d5181cb5017b_1545321_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=39d49d705935a64d"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Paramount Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Paramount Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/zomboy-02-20-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-21T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Zomboy","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Brostep"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/zomboy"},"data":{"Name":"Zomboy"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3ed366f232b3cf2292eb8e1ee44155a1/55a2b4e7/cd8453cb-d664-47f4-abae-3362808f80b7_893831_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=2f3125cf36579d71"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/zomboy-02-20-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-21T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Zomboy","Description":"Originally from a background of more traditional sound engineering, running his own recording studio, recording bands and artists, and gaining a following in America with his solo project \"Place Your Bet$\", it was when he moved to Guildford, UK to study a degree in Music production at the ACM that he discovered a new love for electronic music.&nbsp; Zomboy sites influences such as Skrillex, Reso, Rusko, and Bare Noize as the reason he wanted to dominate the dubstep scene. <br /><br />And dominate he has.

not  only a pioneering jam-grass act, but also one of the most innovative, intricate  groups in the live music scene which is reinforced by its newest member, multi instrumentalist Nick Piccininni.  \nIt’s a testament to the life and legacy of Yonder that three of the  founding members — guitarist Adam Aijala, bassist Ben Kaufmann and  banjoist Dave Johnston — remain at the helm of this American musical  institution, something complemented and accelerated in recent years by the  fiery fiddle work of Allie Kral, who joined the group in 2015.  \n\nThe new album boasts a reinvigorated energy alongside the usual foot-stomping  melodies and sorrowful ballads that reside at the core of the Yonder Mountain  signature sound. \n\nYonder Mountain was the initial spark in an acoustic inferno decades ago that  endures headlong into the 21st

Heavily influenced by a multitude of cultures from around the world, Sabo’s sound holds much of his intrigue. Sabo's productions take you along a journey into sound, a sonic landscape that crosses several musical borders with mixtures of tropical poly-rhythms, warm bass frequencies, rich percussion, lush tribal vocals, and smooth organic textures. When listening you will undoubtedly find yourself resonating with his intention, imagining yourself dancing in an Amazon rainforest or on a desert plane for a Saharan sunrise. Behind the decks, his innovative approach to each DJ set makes him a consistent stand out at Festivals like Coachella, Lightening in a Bottle, Shambhala, Fusion, Symbiosis, Desert Hearts, Further Future, and Burning Man's Robot Heart bus. As a label boss, he is known for his dynamic vision - heading up his imprint label “Sol*Selectas” which is successfully re-defining a new vein of dance music. It was the Top 10 Best Selling Deep House label on Beatport for 2016, with almost every release breaking into the Top 10 charts of their respective genres. The label captures a wide array of sounds, enlisting up and coming underground producers from all over the globe, as well as prominent well known producers in the industry, focusing the sound on deep spiritual dance music, guiding its listeners into the future realm with positive intention.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5921e7accffcd72b23703a7b75b99762/4703b649/339fcb99-a28d-587c-5747-8767740e8f5b?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0a7d650f640afd1a"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-party-portal-02-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-26T07:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"THE PARTY PORTAL","Description":"<H2> ABSOLUTE. |  ACEMO | ASH LAURYN | CHLOÉ CAILLET | DJ MINX | DJ PYTHON | COLLIN MCKENNA | L.A.

A few EPs later, Boris moved from Autist Records to Harthouse. With tracks like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Die Maschinen Sind Gestrandet&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Lost Memory&rdquo;</em>, he combined his unique sound with a maximum of varieties. Consequently, he became the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;exceptional Talent 2007&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in the electronic music magazine Raveline. Boris also created his second alias called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;ANNA&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2007 and had some groundbreaking releases on Autist Records.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>After four years of touring, three albums and lots of singles, Boris became a constant favorite in today's club scene. With his ambition and desire for new and experimental musical directions, he shows his audiences over and over again how exciting minimal techno can be - so much more than just a conglomerate of repetitive and puristic elements.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris created his own music genre&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;High-Tech Minimal&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2012 which has often been referred to as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;the intelligent music of tomorrow&rdquo;</em>. After seven years of working together with Harthouse and his fourth album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Feuerfalter&rdquo;</em>, Boris founded his own label called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Fckng Serious&rdquo;</em>. Together with his best friends Ann Clue and Deniz Bul they want to spread their idea of good music and serious parties around the globe.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In the beginning of 2016, Boris came up with his 5th album called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;22&rdquo;</em>. His unbelievable passion for music combined with the longtime experience as a producer for different genres fuses into this exclusive distinctive and very special sound. Beside that, Boris created his own&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha In Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;show which he first played in Brazil in 2016. These events, a combination of synced visuals, his Joker mask and his music, are a special and unique experience.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 2017, Fckng Serious was the first electronic music label to do a Europe Bus Tour with the full crew travelling on a Nightliner through Europe to play 10 shows in 12 days. Like Rockstars!\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Just a year later we also saw Boris making his much-anticipated debut at Tomorrowland, the Exit Festival as well as the legendary Time Warp. A second sold-out bus tour, this time through France, proved to be successful yet again. In General, things didn't get any slower but even bigger than ever before.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris&rsquo; success story received a further boost in 2019. He already enjoys a superstar status around the world, but that&rsquo;s not enough yet. He sold out huge clubs in the USA within minutes and almost everyone knows him. It is impossible to imagine the techno scene without him and he has earned his place there. Many new singles appeared in 2019 and the number of his listeners spoke volumes. Since 2019 Boris is also under contract with the well-known label&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ultra Music</em>&rdquo;. His music has also been played on the radio. With his specially created&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha in Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;shows, he filled huge halls with up to 15,000 people without any problems.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In 2020, his success story begins even more promisingly than in the previous year. He started the year with a long-awaited album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Space Diver&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and he has already had a talk show appearance on German television. His name already adorns numerous line-ups of the most famous festivals around the world. USA, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia are just a few of the countries where Boris will be performing again this year. Besides a documentary about his life, we can look forward to many new surprises this year.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/boris-brejcha"},"data":{"Name":"Boris Brejcha"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/90b3837573af56e4408dbb80b12a9b27/9800591c/boris-brejcha-tickets_03-04-22_18_6125260391b79.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=547376c37fb5ced8"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/justin-martin-03-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-05T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Justin Martin","Description":"Show 9:00PM | Doors 10:00PM | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.”\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do...’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”\n","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/justin-martin"},"data":{"Name":"Justin Martin"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a168e5bc17b8c164ebd7a7f583454f57/5bfc7445/d376e7fa-071b-fa53-98c5-990edcfa7ff6?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=2b5237c514d2d115"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/lil-tecca-tecca-loves-you-tour-03-05-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-06T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Lil Tecca - Tecca Loves You Tour","Description":"ALL AGES WELCOME THE FILLMORE AUDITORIUM IS A GENERAL ADMISSION VENUE WITH LIMITED SEATING AREAS AVAILABLE.

Often referred to as “The Master of Emotion” his music is patently beautiful and melodic.  With diverse influences ranging from trip-hop, classical and Arabic to bass driven compositions, his songs are considered anthemic and timeless.  As a multi-instrumentalist and singer, his tracks are organic, uplifting and stand on their own as a distinct genre.  Listeners of all types of music can find something they can relate to in his sound.  He has toured extensively across North America, including tours with Bassnectar, Shpongle, Emancipator, Beats Antique, and has headlined dozens festivals across the U.S. and internationally. \n\nThere is no doubt that Rab understands a multitude of musical styles.  He has been the front man of a heavy metal band, toured as a classical trumpet player, played bass in a country music band, was a scratch DJ for a jazz fusion project, was the singer for a rock band in Mexico and has collaborated with countless musicians of all styles.  From acoustic performances in the Himalayas to rocking packed clubs in New York, Random Rab has found a way to connect with people of all kinds. \n\nWith a dedicated fanbase born from the San Francisco underground, Random Rab has become known worldwide for his sunrise sets that have now become one of his most sought after performances.  Having played before 3 solar eclipses and at the Pyramids of Giza, Random Rab has created a unique niche for his equally danceable, yet thought-provoking compositions.    His current popularity can often be traced to his breakout album, The Elucidation of Sorrow and in particular his first hit, The Riddle and followed up by hits such as Release, Falling Tao, For My Corpse and Apparently.  His critically acclaimed current and 10th album Formless Edge, catapulted him into the state of momentum that is now taking hold internationally.  \n\n<H3>  Equanimous </H3> \n\nEquanimous is a music producer, DJ, and multi-instrumentalist. He combines elements of downtempo, bass, house, and melodic dance music to create a joyous high vibrational atmosphere on the dance @loor. Equanimous expands the electronic music experience by playing live djembe, keys, and beatboxing along with his tracks. He’s known for his deep bass, beautiful melodies, live looping, and creative rhythmic beats that take people into a state of euphoric dancing and heart-centered bliss.\n\n<H3> Skysia </H3> \n\nForgoing electronic music’s inherent heaviness for a spiritualized serenity and elegant songcraft, Skysia fuses elements of melodic bass, chill-step, and modern downtempo into a euphonious sound. The producer/composer often reveals a minimalist, deliciously danceable style; his translucent low-end theory is rich in musicality and steeped in dreamy psychedelia.

An artist who demonstrates an ever-increasing mastery of his craft, ‘Tread’ is a record that is at once sleek and melodic but also eminently danceable, nostalgic but brilliantly modern, with nods to sounds and styles that are not so much reflected but refracted and recontextualised through Clary Weatherall’s lens.\n\nIn 2018—following a handful of revered and sought-after singles and EPs throughout the mid-2010’s on labels such as Breaker Breaker, Lobster Theremin, Distant Hawaii, Magicwire and Molten Jets—Ross From Friends announced his signing to Flying Lotus’ legendary Brainfeeder label with the release of his ‘Aphelion’ EP. Accelerating a sonic shift that continues to this day, the release was characterised by an obsessive attention to detail that manages to marry an intricately layered production style with warm, heavily saturated sonics and emotive songwriting.\n\nThis was followed the same year by his debut album ‘Family Portrait’—the culmination of almost two years of intense studio time, working 20 hour days, and often spending months perfecting just one aspect of a track. ‘Family Portrait’ was hailed as “a powerful debut” by Crack Magazine and was described by Mixmag as “a gliding and glittering tour de force” in their ‘Albums of the Year 2018’ roundup. NME praised Clary Weatherall’s unique sonic identity as “a mind-melting picture that takes in house, techno, jazz and ambient music, and ties it together to make something distinctly unique” and Rolling Stone declared him “a master of fun, gooey textures”. Similar praise came from the likes of Resident Advisor, The Wire, Pitchfork, AV Club, Loud & Quiet, DJ Mag, Clash, PopMatters, FADER and more.\n\nOn an album that was dedicated to, and inspired in part, by his parents, a particular highlight was the release of the official video for “Pale Blue Dot”. Made up of footage shot by his mum when she and his dad had just met, the video follows his parents-to-be on a bus trip around Europe in 1990, travelling through France, Belgium, West and East Germany (though returning through a unified one) and beyond, setting up their makeshift sound system in towns and villages in order to share their passion for the sounds of hi-NRG dance, Italo disco and proto-Techno through spontaneous parties in whatever venue they could find.\n\n2019’s ‘Epiphany’ EP, also on Brainfeeder, was dedicated to (and named after) Clary Weatherall’s sister: “One of the most important role models I have” he said at the time. Constructed with the dancefloor at the forefront of his mind, the three tracks assembled on “Epiphany” represented a sleeker and tougher sound than his acclaimed debut, but with his signature warmth and personality is ever present. Continuing his interest in the visual realm the EP artwork was created by legendary pro skateboarder artist Chad Muska, and the titular lead single came with an animated video directed by Theo Nunn (Lisbon Studio), guiding the viewer through a psychedelic sci-fi dystopia.\n\nMore recently, Clary Weatherall launched his own label Scarlet Tiger as an outlet for releasing his own productions alongside “friends and folk I’ve met online over the years”, marking the inaugural release with his own ‘Burner’ single in January 2021, followed by an EP from RFF band mate Cameo Blush, and most recently by an EP from Giulia Tess in August.\n\nNow, Ross From Friends has released ‘Tread’, a showcase of his ever evolving talent, dailling up the intricate and emotive qualities of his production style that have previously led Mixmag to praise his “idiosyncratic dexterity that not only makes your heart ache, but dance right out of your chest”. Central to the creation of ‘Tread’ is “Thresho”, a piece of software designed and built by Felix himself —and available via Ableton’s Max For Live platform—that starts recording once the audio hits a user-defined threshold, then stops once it goes below that threshold, automatically saving and indexing the resulting clips alongside timestamps. This led to a revelation in how he approached the production and writing on ‘Tread’, and meant he spent the first six months just experimenting with his hardware, not actually committing to any music, but with “Thresho” quietly recording everything he was doing, each session leaving its mark on an ever expanding library of his own samples. When he later came to composing the album, he was then able to draw on specific moments, either recalling the exact date or time he had made a recording, or simply browsing the now vast audio library of his own making. \n\nWith ‘Thresho’ being so integral to the album Felix also made the decision to share this vast bank of recordings that were the foundations of ‘Tread’ and in doing so, offer up a peek behind the scenes at the creative process of one electronic music’s most individual and compelling voices. Fans have been invited to explore this resource and share their interpretations, versions, iterations and interactions.\n\nA cornerstone of Ross From Friends music has always been the blistering Ross From Friends 3-man live show—comprising Felix, Jed Hampson & John Dunk—that delivers a killer blend of live musicianship (guitar, keys and sax) and electronics and has graced stages at the likes of Coachella, Glastonbury, Primavera and Sonar to name a few. With multiple sold-out dates across previous tours throughout the UK, EU, Australia and North America, the trio are returning to a headline tour in the UK, Europe and North America in 2022.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/ross-from-friends"},"data":{"Name":"Ross from Friends"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e0331a411ad396a0c96a4b90dec18bf2/cf8d0498/ac21ab8c-f95f-4dbb-9689-d0b8698975d3?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1aa857e6319c4a91"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/dancing-with-the-stars-live-2022-tour-03-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-11T02:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-03-11T01:30:00.000Z","Name":"Dancing with the Stars: Live! - 2022 Tour","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b273ae99b1edf8a8055f02a11720d933/fddd26fd/2718da8b-9e29-48f5-bbae-beb4151872aa_1523521_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=23fbcb5f34c3cb90"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Paramount Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Paramount Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/fruition-03-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-12T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Fruition","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/fruition"},"data":{"Name":"Fruition"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4c2033e05b4d2c819f8742161dd4de48/4fe335b6/de187673-95a6-4323-8a58-2c8fbe7951f5_1602651_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=49f6293a08f30942"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/robert-earl-keen-waylon-payne-03-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-12T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Robert Earl Keen, Waylon Payne","Description":"18 & older / opening act at 8:00PM","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/robert-earl-keen"},"data":{"Name":"Robert Earl Keen"}},{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/waylon-payne"},"data":{"Name":"Waylon Payne"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a0cfa9a9f151100bfc4ba5525193a60d/30c3ccce/c98337e6-c650-4882-b4e0-84bce2988da1_1523511_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=8e350e510b01a988"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Grizzly Rose"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/grizzly-rose"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Grizzly Rose"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/emo-nite-la-03-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-12T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Emo Nite La","Description":"DOORS: 9:00 PM SHOW: 9:00 PM THIS SHOW IS: 21 + In the best interest of fans and staff, the Event Organizer is monitoring local COVID-19 trends and will meet or exceed protocols mandated by local governments.

Regardless of life’s accomplishments and catastrophes, the band, rounded out by (drummer) Danny Cooper, definitely accentuate the importance of continuing on. Critical Mistakes EP opening track and lead single “Critical Mistakes” professes “Come wake me up before I die and never get to live,” before adding “let the tide wash away my critical mistakes”. Unwilling to rest easy, 888 is consistently pushing forward and actively reaching for more.\n  \nThe duo won KTCL’s 2015 “Hometown For The Holidays” competition in both fan voting and live performance categories, cementing their place in Denver’s burgeoning music scene and garnering the attention of radio stations all across the country. 888 has since headlined Alt Nation’s Advanced Placement Tour, opened for Andrew McMahon, The Rocket Summer, and secured festival appearances at summer staples like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Bottlerock, ACL, Hangout Music Festival and more.

Canadian musician Jeff Hartford’s enthusiasm for music began at a young age, he grew up playing in bands and learning instruments like piano, trumpet, and guitar. His immersion in songwriting continued to grow when he attended university, and he interned for a composer after completing his courses. It was during this time that he started applying the techniques he’d learned in the studio to electronic music and began sending his completed works to deadmau5’s mau5trap label. The label initially signed a few tracks and then ATTLAS as an artist, and Hartford released three EPs in 2015 via the Canadian imprint. In the years since then, he’s delivered singles, EPs, and remixes – all showcasing the textured, introspective sound he’s spent years cultivating. 2019 brought exciting new developments to the ATTLAS journey, including a new installment of his lauded Storyline series and a debut album. The album “synthesized all the experiences and wandering paths that ATTLAS walks,” according to Hartford, bringing together heavier sounds and the emotive melodies he’s built his musical brand on. 2020 proved difficult for everyone; Hartford included who was forced to cancel his ‘Lavender God Tour’, named for his debut album. Rather than focusing on the missed opportunities, Jeff has taken this year to dive even deeper into his musical craft. After a few one off releases and several remixes, including a captivating melodic single “The Night Air Was Cool”, Jeff released his second album at the top of November. The latest album, titled ‘Out Here With You’, encompasses the shift in the music industry and the way we’re digesting music without live touring. Rawer and more intimate than ever before, ‘Out Here With You’ is Jeff’s way of showing his fans and the world that we were not alone during this troubling time and that we’re all trying to navigate the state of the current world together. 2021 brought new heights to Jeff’s career, most notably a Juno nomination for Best Electronic album for his inaugural ‘Lavender God’. iding off the high of this great honor, Jeff has gotten back on the road touring and is excited to drop his 3rd album later this year on Mau5trap. Be sure to keep an eye on this one, for this is just the beginning for ATTLAS.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/attlas"},"data":{"Name":"ATTLAS"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/af51c9c1224f606cea961cf2d9fbf679/13a79bfb/55e1ad47-0b46-f580-cd51-405a706b162a?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cd74ff272af55381"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-sling-tour-clairo-with-arlo-parks-03-20-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-21T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Sling Tour: Clairo with Arlo Parks","Description":"You must be 16 years old or older with a valid ID to enter the Fillmore Auditorium.

If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\nAs kids, SUMMER SALT knew what they were running toward. Now, they’re ready to ruminate on what they’ve left behind.\n\nIn a way, the trop-pop duo – singer/guitarist Matthew Terry and drummer Eugene Chung – have been building to their brand-new album, SEQUOIA MOON, ever since jettisoning their Dallas, Texas, hometown for the arts-and-culture oasis of Austin after graduating high school in the early 2010s. The band quickly rose through the ranks of the local Austin scene with their 2014 debut Driving To Hawaii, teeming with both the escapism and recklessness of youth and the composure and charm of ‘60s-era pop, doo wop and bossa nova.\n\n2018’s Happy Camper, 2019’s Honeyweed and 2020’s Avenue G further cemented the band’s place as one of the indie genre’s brightest stars. Summer Salt soared past 1 million monthly Spotify listeners and toured the world, all as Live Nation’s Ones To Watch and American Songwriter hailed them for their breezy, synesthetic soundscapes.\n\nThat streak will continue with SEQUOIA MOON. Produced by Phil Ek (Modest Mouse, Built To Spill, Fleet Foxes), the 12-song set, due out June 25 through Cherry Lime Records via The Orchard, finds Terry and Chung contemplating many of the same themes that drove them to pursue their dreams a decade ago – leaving, longing, returning back again – with the benefit of years in the rearview mirror.\n\n“There’s a lot of running away on this album,” Terry says, noting SEQUOIA MOON is, at its core, a record about transitions: intrapersonally, interpersonally, and in the scope of the world at large. The songs are culled from diverse periods throughout the band’s history – standout “Colors Of Your Love,” among others, dates all the way back to 2013 – but their themes are timeless and indelible, detailing life at its most basic: the push toward a bright, bold future while looking back fondly on what’s led you there.\n\nThat juxtaposition is well represented musically, too. The hallmarks of Summer Salt are alive and well – the jazzy dynamism of “Hocus Pocus” and first single “Monday’s Facil,” the peaceful solemnity of “Trouble In Paradise” – while newer elements like synths and additional percussion push the band’s sound forward with a newfound moodiness and tension.\n\nTerry hails Chung as a grounding presence to his own eccentric, blue-sky extravagance, and when the principals meet in the middle on SEQUOIA MOON, listeners are left with the edge and emotion of the band’s early work filtered through a more mature lens. As such, the album stands as another hallmark in a career of era-defying art that spans genres and generations – offering audiences the perfect blend between substance and sunniness.\n\n“We loved writing this album with the hope that other people can relate to our stories and bring them some peace this summer,” Chung says.

If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\nIsrael Vibration was founded by Cecil \"Skelly\" Spence (born in 1952), Lacelle \"Wiss\" Bulgin (born in 1955), and Albert \"Apple Gabriel\" Craig (born in 1955, deceased in 2020). They were victims of the polio epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950's. Skelly, Wiss, and Apple met at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic in Kingston, where they got together to fund the group a few years later. Skelly and Wiss were members of the first musical group from Mona, the SKA Band \"Hot Lickers\", which appeared on TV when Skelly was only 12 years old. Apple attended Alpha Boys School, the musical birthplace of many legendary Jamaican artists.\n\nThe three young men adopted Rastafarian faith and decided to create a vocal group, initially called \"Israel Vibration, Israel Vibrates”, soon renamed to \"Israel Vibration.\" In the beginning, they knocked at the doors of many studios, meeting different producers who used to listen to them acknowledging their talent, but without giving a chance to record.\n\nEverything started to change when in 1975, they were at the gate of Channel One Studios. Maurice \"Blacka Morwell\" Wellington (one of the founding members of the Morwells alongside Errol \"Flabba\" Holt) saw them over there, auditioned them at the gate and let them in. Flabba was there on this day also. They recorded their first song \"Bad Intention\" with Skelly on lead vocals, but the track was not released.\n\nTwelve Tribes of Israel, an essential branch of Rastafari faith, gave them great support in that period through the person of Hugh Booth, one of their members. The Twelve Tribes label took them to record their debut single that was released - \"Why Worry”, a song that has an important message to connect people to God. The track was released in late 1976 and got massive distribution in early 1977. The single was successful and placed them on the spotlights to be the opening act for other artists, such as Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley.\n\nAfter that, they started to work with producer Tommy Cowan and released the single \"The Same Song\" through his Top Ranking label in 1977. The single was followed by the album of the same name in 1978 and \"Israel Tafari\" (aka \"The Same Song DUB\"). \"The Same Song\" (and its DUB version) were very successful internationally, leading Israel Vibration to a deal with EMI. The album was reissued in the UK, and they also started working on a second album, \"Unconquered People\", recorded later at Tuff Gong Studios and backed by members of The Wailers band.\n\nTheir third album, \"Why You so Craven\", produced by Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes, was released in 1981, a year in which the dancehall movement started to grow steadily in Jamaica. After relocating to New York in 1982, the group split and reunited only in 1987, after getting positive feedback from Gary \"Dr. Dread\" Hilmefarb, founder of RAS Records. That was the beginning of an era.\n\nThey were flown to Washington, DC to record a new album at the Lion and Fox Recording Studios in Maryland, backed by the Roots Radics. The backing band, led by Errol \"Flabba\" Holt, Eric \"Bingy Bunny\" Lamont (both ex-members of the Morwells), still works with Israel Vibration until today. The album recorded was \"Strength of My Life\", released in 1988. The partnership with RAS lasted for years, and they recorded some more essential albums for Reggae Music industry: \"Praises\" (1990), \"Forever\" (1991), \"Vibes Alive\" (1992), \"IV\" (1993), \"On the Rock\" (1995), \"Free to Move\" (1996), \"Live Again\" (1997), \"Pay the Piper\" (1998), and \"Jericho\" (2000). Some of these albums also gained a DUB Version.\n\nIn 1997 Apple Gabriel left the group and started a solo career. Skelly and Wiss continued to record albums and are touring the world since then as Israel Vibration & the Roots Radics band. They played in major Reggae Festivals and Clubs for huge crowds and still headline some of the most important musical events of the world after over 45 years in music. In 2010 they got their first Grammy Nomination with \"Reggae Knights\". If you are new to their music and message, just mention the name Israel Vibration to any Reggae enthusiast in the world and get their reaction. This group is history.\n\nSocial Media\ninstagram.com/realisraelvibration\n\nOfficial Website\nrealisraelvibration.com","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/israel-vibration"},"data":{"Name":"Israel Vibration"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4484eeb8dcf809e2675b3e44b583c523/66c36cf8/dc20968c-3d28-874d-96ab-29732ee040e6?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6652e7b398bf43b6"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/vibes-on-vibes-tour-eric-bellinger-x-sammie-03-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-29T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Vibes On Vibes Tour: Eric Bellinger x Sammie","Description":"DOORS: 7:00 PM SHOW: 8:00 PM In the best interest of fans and staff, the Event Organizer is monitoring local COVID-19 trends and will meet or exceed protocols mandated by local governments.

Having endured the tumult of the breakup of her band and subsequent divorce&mdash; as well as far more joyful events like a new marriage and the birth of her first child&mdash; Potter continued writing on her own, but had no intention of sharing those songs with the world. &ldquo;Too many things had happened, and I needed to take a step back,&rdquo; says the Vermont-born artist. &ldquo;There were moments where I thought, &lsquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll just go back to painting houses.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBut by the end of 2017, Potter began to feel the call of the studio and soon started laying down tracks in the Topanga Canyon home she&rsquo;d recently settled into with her husband, Midnight producer Eric Valentine. Unsigned and entirely free of any pressure to appease, Potter slowly carved out the songs that now make up Daylight: an album that emerges as her most emotionally revealing, musically daring, and exactingly realized body of work to date.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&ldquo;In the past, I&rsquo;ve aimed to write songs from a universal perspective; so that anyone who heard my music could relate, but that actually made it harder for me to take ownership of my own perspective. This new collection of songs were all written so that I could process &ndash; and be accountable for &ndash; my own life experience,&rdquo; Potter says. &ldquo;I had just pulled the ripcord on my whole life. It was an incredibly jarring, private experience. When the dust settled a bit, the last thing I wanted to do was tell the whole world about it. It was a very gradual process of re-framing music and its purpose in my life. So when I finally started writing songs again - I did it for me.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"284\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"285\">Potter&rsquo;s seventh full-length and first release for Fantasy Records, Daylight was created in close collaboration with producer/mixer/engineer Eric Valentine. In constructing the album&rsquo;s wild collage of rock-and-roll, blues and soul, Potter tapped into her tightly honed musicianship while harnessing the untamed energy of her live performance for the very first time. &ldquo;I had kind of resigned myself to the fact that I was always going to be better live than in the studio - but Eric was determined to tap into that raw energy that I have onstage.&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He chased down a few different approaches, ultimately creating a kind of live music venue setup in his studio, so I could feel the sound reflecting off the walls and interact with the band instead of just singing into a void.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span>\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"284\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"285\"><br /></span></span>\r\nPartly recorded in Potter&rsquo;s garage and living room, Daylight mostly came to life through a series of liveto-tape sessions at Valentine&rsquo;s Hollywood studio, Barefoot Recording. Along with capturing the undeniable vocal power Potter&rsquo;s previously shown in sharing the stage with The Rolling Stones, Robert Plant, and Neil Young, the album unfolds with an irresistibly vital sound birthed with the help of guests like Benmont Tench and Lucius. &ldquo;Having all these incredible musicians playing live in the room with me gave the recording an urgency&mdash;like, this matters right now,&rdquo; Potter recalls.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOn the album-opener &ldquo;Love Is Love,&rdquo; Potter brings that urgency to a breathtaking slow-burner, her voice shifting from fragile to soaring with understated elegance. The very first piece written for Daylight, the track finds Potter fully surrendering to unbridled feeling&mdash;a process so unsettling, it temporarily put her off from attempting any further self-examination in song form. &ldquo;&lsquo;Love Is Love&rsquo; is so confessional, it was terrifying. I dove deep into the darkest corners of my personal life.&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;After we recorded the demo, I had no desire to keep on writing because the feelings were still too raw. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to dig any deeper.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"289\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"290\">&nbsp;Just one song later, Potter proves to have wholly conquered that fear, turning out a full-tilt rocker raging with pure passion. With her vocals taking on a gravelly intensity, &ldquo;On My Way&rdquo; telegraphs unhinged joy as Potter documents a particularly fraught moment from the past few years when she took a solo drive across the country. &ldquo;Once you allow certain feelings in, there&rsquo;s no turning back.&rdquo; Freewheeling and cathartic, &ldquo;On My Way&rdquo; builds its frenetic tension in part from a riff that she and Valentine conjured up on their back porch. &ldquo;Musically, it&rsquo;s meant to take you in two directions&mdash;there&rsquo;s a powerful tension between darkness &amp; light. It&rsquo;s a theme that plays out a lot on this record, and that riff kinda just says it all.&rdquo; Potter notes.&nbsp;</span></span>\r\n<span data-identifyelement=\"289\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-identifyelement=\"290\"><br /></span></span>\r\nThroughout Daylight, Potter imbues her songs with equal parts aching vulnerability and unapologetic self-possession. A stark piano ballad partly written while Potter was in the process of moving out of her home, &ldquo;Release&rdquo; transmits a quiet sorrow but ultimately finds its resolution in a lyric supplied by cowriter Mike Busbee (&ldquo;I hope that someday/The sun will shine again/And you&rsquo;ll release me too&rdquo;). On &ldquo;Repossession,&rdquo; meanwhile, Potter sharply contrasts the song&rsquo;s sleepy rhythm, dreamy guitar tones, and unearthly harmonies with a brilliant lyrical barb (&ldquo;And you say/That I threw it all away for nothing/But the only thing I threw away/Was you&rdquo;). &ldquo;We were driving through the Southwest; we stopped at a pawnshop and bought this busted old guitar with a missing string, dragged it out to these vast sand dunes and just started playing,&rdquo; Potter recalls in revealing the song&rsquo;s origins. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d been listening to a lot of classic country and AM radio on the road trip. These heart-wrenching songs spoke directly to what we were going through - and even though they were recorded over 50 years ago, it felt like they&rsquo;d been reading my diary - so when we sat down to write, &lsquo;Repossession&rsquo; just happened. Like it had always been there, just waiting for someone to show up and claim it.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhile much of Daylight mirrors the emotional chaos of her recent past, the album also channels a certain soulful wonder on songs like &ldquo;Every Heartbeat,&rdquo; an acoustic-guitar-laced serenade for Valentine and their infant son, Sagan. And on &ldquo;Desire,&rdquo; Daylight drifts into an unpredictably playful mood, serving up a sweetly winking celebration of unabashed lust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often cloaked my carnal themes in metaphor.&rdquo; Potter notes. &ldquo;Ultimately that approach lost a lot value for me. I was tired of burying my desires, my truth, my pain&hellip;in euphemisms. I had to start over &amp; rebuild my sense of self, so I went straight to the source with a song that celebrates the fact that we&rsquo;re all just animals.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOn the title track and finale to Daylight, Potter offers up one of the album&rsquo;s most galvanizing and glorious moments: a shapeshifting epic that endlessly careens from simmering blues lament to brutally thunderous rock-and-roll anthem. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a song about the darkest time.&rdquo; Potter recalls. &ldquo;We started composing that song because we wanted to honor the long, difficult process of finding peace. It&rsquo;s a musical bookmark; and a reminder that darkness doesn&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFor Potter, the making of Daylight marks a return to the unfettered creativity she felt upon first discovering songwriting. &ldquo;I really dug back into the roots of my creativity. When I was 12 or 13, I would sneak away to write songs because I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to hear me bearing all,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was all so honest, because I had no awareness of how people might perceive me.&rdquo; At the same time, she made use of the masterful chops she&rsquo;s developed over the course of her career, a 15-year run that&rsquo;s included playing nearly every major music festival (in addition to launching her own festival, Burlington&rsquo;s Grand Point North. &ldquo;Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of a tinkerer; experimenting &amp; exploring all these different facets of who I am through music,&rdquo; says Potter. &ldquo;But this album isn&rsquo;t an experiment: it&rsquo;s a statement.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs she shares that statement with the world, Potter hopes that Daylight&rsquo;s fearless honesty might inspire each listener to embrace their own truth, in all its messy complexity. &ldquo;This album is about being able to take complete ownership of your feelings, without any anger or hate or shame. And that can be absolutely terrifying&mdash; but once you get to the other side, it&rsquo;s exhilarating. It&rsquo;s the feeling of knowing that you&rsquo;re finally home.&rdquo;","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/grace-potter"},"data":{"Name":"Grace Potter"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/00669282f61e117cbbafd4829960a96b/b058f688/grace-potter-tickets_03-28-20_18_5d89380ef3f6f.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=41156315a64e34e2"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/flor-03-28-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-29T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"flor","Description":"DOORS 8:00PM | SHOW 9:00PM | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Grace began experimenting with electronic music-making programs to create ear-catching synth sounds. Bauld built tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that updated the sound of the '80s for the 21st century. After moving to Los Angeles, Flor connected with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who helped the band come up with distinctive visuals; meanwhile, Bauld established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like Halsey, Lights, Smallpools and Lostboycrow. The band released its debut single, \"Heart,\" online in 2014, with the Sounds EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length Sights & Sounds, Flor signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2016, which reissued the Sounds EP that February.

She has a  colourful and playful vision of music, thanks to her synaesthesia, and is forever exploring  artistic topics in creative and innovative ways. She is loved by peers, fans, and tastemakers  alike for her authenticity and her unquenchable curiosity, forever connecting with her  listeners through her sets, releases, and via her label ‘United’, on which she will release her  next album ‘Quantum Love’ at the end of 2021.  \n\nThe solo project of Giorgia Angiuli stylistically moves between melodic and techno  electronica. She uses her voice to create an ethereal dimension, intensified by the unique  combination of tech she uses. Her live set up is never the same as she constantly explores  new live techniques.  \n\nDuring her live performance she combines synths, drums, theremin, modified toys for kids  and many Bluetooth midi controllers. She collaborates with several brands, always happy to  test new gear. Curiosity is the key in her life. Mixing samples and loops she shapes a  vibrating and energetic groove that sets the dance floor on fire. She recently started a  collaboration with the brand Aodyo, creating a musical instrument ‘Sylphyo’ - Giorgia  Angiuli’s edition.  \n","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/giorgia-angiuli"},"data":{"Name":"Giorgia Angiuli"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/62de91ebdd588a45b7dc949dc727f8c8/e175e938/5da27794-5946-c02e-ca7f-0a55dae2e2b2?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7dca52ad3d58f213"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/zoso-a-tribute-to-led-zeppelin-04-01-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-04-02T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Zoso - A Tribute to Led Zeppelin","Description":"DOORS: 7:00 PM SHOW: 8:00 PM THIS SHOW IS: ALL AGES In the best interest of fans and staff, the Event Organizer is monitoring local COVID-19 trends and will meet or exceed protocols mandated by local governments.

This nonstop world-touring artist found his signature sound through his numerous productions and live sets, all characterized by a melodic style of techno.\n\nThe adventure began in 2007 when he released his first hit \"Air conditionné\", which quickly ranked #1 in Beatport sales – the first of a long series of number ones to come. \nIn 2010, Julian signed with two prestigious labels: Cocoon, on which he released the “Color” EP – its single \"Soho\" ranked #1 in the Beatport Techno Top 100 -, and Plus 8 Records. The same year, the “Techno Corner” EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof's label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (“Stay Down”). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP, ‘Hermanos’ with Plus 8 Records.\n \nIn 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP). One year later, he started the year with two remixes for prestigious artists Deadmau5 & Pan-Pot that both charted #1 in the Beatport Techno Top Ten. They were followed by the excellent “Mad” EP with Form Music. He also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin's renowned label: “Don't Think” EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), “She's Hot” EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track \"Unanswered question\" on Drumcode – which went straight at Number 1 on Beatport.   In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: “Rumble” and “Los Pistolos” EP.\n\nIn 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, “Bird”, on Minus and a remix, “COAR,” commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored. Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released – commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist’s greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport’s monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks: “And We”, “Meteorite”, “Bird” and “Wax”. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. \n\nIn 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, “Destination”, an instant success, followed by two equally successful remixes for Matador & Felix da Housecat, “The Enemy” (Rukus) and « Fuego » for Dubfire & Oliver Huntemann (Senso). One year later, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, “Rolling” and “Space”.\n\nIn 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, “Transmission” LP, also on Drumcode. The album was an early 2019 monstrous hit, generating multiple Beatport chart-toppers and hitting the Top 3 All Genres charts. \n\nThe year 2020 saw another successful release on Drumcode, “Schema” EP, a remix in March for Klaudia Gawlas on Form Music (“Time Loop”) and a long-awaited collaboration EP with POPOF : “Dance Escape” (Filth on Acid), released this Fall. More recently, Julian Jeweil has released a remix for Reinier Zonneveld “Eating Concreté’’ on Filth On Acid.

Vynehall","Description":"Doors 8:00PM | Show 9:00PM \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit. If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\nLeon Vynehall has already proved himself to be that rare thing -- an artist with his own agenda rather than a producer aping the sound of the day. To date his off kilter sounds have come in the form of EPs on labels like 3024, Rush Hour and Running Back, and have been carefully crafted things, layered with musicality whilst never straying too far from a infectious groove.\n\nTaking obvious foundations from house, techno, disco, funk, hip-hop and soul, Vynehall's music incorporates many elements from his musical past too: his journey began with playing drums and the piano in bands as a teenager -- which manifests itself in the raw, live sound he strives for in his productions -- while much of his spare time is spent listening to anything from classical and orchestral compositions to post-punk. His work has seen him dabble in tempos, palettes and styles, but all the time managing to keep his songs coherently 'Vynehall.'\n\n\"I like chords, I like atmosphere and some sort of emotion in music. Rather than it being just about the dance floor, I like it being a bit of both. I like to take a sound and change it, manipulating things so they sound a bit dusty. With drums, I like to make them sound more human. I prefer dance music that isn't quantized, regimented, and super mixed down to the nano-perfect spot. I'm a believer in the fact that music doesn't have to sound professional to sound great. Mastering engineers hate me.\"\n\nHis 2014 release, 'Music For The Uninvited,' was a turning point in his career. Resident Advisor scored the EP a 4.5 out of five, calling it \"one of the most eclectic and rewarding house records you'll hear all year.\" Clash wrote that, \"If this is what being uninvited is like, we're totally cool with missing the party,\" while The Washington Post said that it \"couldn't be much more of a delight.\" It went on to gain end of year accolades from publications as wide ranging as Pitchfork, NPR and Gorilla vs. Bear, and saw Vynehall begin a relentless touring schedule that has taken him from Berlin's Panorama Bar and Ibiza's DC-10 to festival stages as far afield as Los Angeles, Sydney and Tokyo.\n\n'Rojus' -- the 2016 follow up to 'Music For The Uninvited' -- was equally acclaimed, being named 'Best New Music' by Pitchfork, 'Best Album' at the DJ Mag Awards, and lauded by the likes of Mixmag, Billboard and Mojo.\n\nVynehall's DJ style is eclectic, considered and always surprising, and has been expertly reflected in his popular mixes for the likes of FACT and XLR8R, with the latter commenting that his contribution to their podcast series \"quite possibly raised more questions than it answered.\" His debut Radio 1 Essential Mix proved so popular that it went on to be shortlisted by the BBC as one of the 5 best Essential Mixes of 2016. Something of a media recluse, all we really know about Leon Vynehall is from his music -- so far it's proved a fascinating story.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ca1d7ca7dfef3dd7a672af1816684473/9a154620/c04cd3c2-32f7-7b05-3495-74ff2e9f2bee?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7bb3fb715d73e4b7"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/brantley-gilbert-05-06-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-07T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Brantley Gilbert","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/brantley-gilbert"},"data":{"Name":"Brantley Gilbert"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8318bcfd970a70de4ba487e1f33d1c13/b067263f/d0ebc6e5-9ac2-4fbf-b0a5-603d35521fa8_1416421_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1649527891&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7e689823de7d7174"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Red Rocks Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/brantley-gilbert-05-06-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-07T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":"2022-05-07T04:00:00.000Z","DoorsTime":"2022-05-06T23:30:00.000Z","Name":"Brantley Gilbert 5/6","Description":"<p><strong>BRANTLEY GILBERT scheduled at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 7th 2021,&nbsp; has Rescheduled t</strong><strong>o&nbsp;<span>May 6th, 2022.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>There is nothing you need to do as your tickets will be valid for the new date.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>AEG Presents</strong> is thrilled to announce BRANTLEY GILBERT live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on Friday, May 6th, 2022.</p>\r\n<p class=\"xxmsolistparagraph\"></p>","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/brantley-gilbert"},"data":{"Name":"Brantley Gilbert"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a1d08341b5c5e16ff206ab75e1b8b999/9eff0265/brantley-gilbert-tickets_05-08-20_86_5d713e32cf38a.jpg?ts=1649527890&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=14767a6d36cefa7f"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Red Rocks Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/mat-kearney-the-january-flower-tour-05-06-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-07T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Mat Kearney - The January Flower Tour","Description":"DOORS - 7PM SHOW - 8PM You must be 16 years old or older with a valid ID to enter the Fillmore Auditorium.
