They both grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. James played piano and Roddick played drums prior to the band's inception, but neither play them as a primary instrument for Purity Ring. During live shows, Roddick uses a custom built, tree-shaped instrument to drive both live sound and lighting. Additionally, during live appearances both wear clothes custom designed and sewn by James.\n\nThe duo were originally two of several members of the band of GOBBLE GOBBLE (now Born Gold). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Purity+Ring\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Number_Of_Events":null,"SpotifyFollowers":550569,"Genres":["Electropop","Art Pop","Indietronica","Metropopolis","Canadian Electropop","Chillwave","Shimmer Pop","Escape Room","Edmonton Indie","Grave Wave","Dream Pop"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1fe114fd08a85e360227a9187fd5b36f/f994ef29/ab6761610000e5eb18cbc12ce582efd3b5ae4606"}]}}}]},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/purity-ring-tour-de-womb-12-01-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-02T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Purity Ring - tour de womb","Subtitle":"w/ Dawn Richard","Description":"<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">WOMB is the newest offering from Purity Ring of Edmonton, Canada, and their third album on 4AD.

The striking vulnerability of &ldquo;ruby insides&rdquo; - &ldquo;If I could, I would let you see through me&rdquo; - charts a course that&rsquo;s both intensely personal and deeply connected to those close to us, our kin whether by nature or nurture. As the ground shifts beneath their feet, WOMB&rsquo;s characters help one another face death, despair, and world-altering discovery with resilience and grace. </span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\" dir=\"ltr\"><br /></span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\" dir=\"ltr\">For all the terrain it encompasses, Womb&rsquo;s quest culminates in &ldquo;stardew&rdquo;, a glittering, transcendent invitation to &ldquo;just be where you are&rdquo; - to experience the kind of powerful peace that can only be found by truly coming home.&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Electropop","Art Pop","Indietronica","Metropopolis","Canadian Electropop","Chillwave","Shimmer Pop","Escape Room","Edmonton Indie","Grave Wave","Dream Pop","Alternative R B","Art Pop","Urban Contemporary","R B","Afrofuturism"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d288c033267e23d95c24b8ac894e3409/33fce8b1/uploadedimage_5e4c207d4ebe1.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"genre":"Grave Wave","genreRegex":"/Grave Wave/gi","today":"2021-11-09T12:25:18.591Z","slug":"/browse/genres/grave-wave"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
