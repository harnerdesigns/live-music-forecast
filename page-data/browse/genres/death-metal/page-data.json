The band's style is most easily described as djent or groove metal with some jazz influence. They use extended polymetric passages, polyrhythmic drum patterns, angular, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. Their lineup has always been consistent, apart from bass which has been handled by many people since the band’s inception. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Meshuggah\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Number_Of_Events":null,"SpotifyFollowers":null,"Genres":["Alternative Metal","Death Metal"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1de96536b11566b23cda4a4082752a96/2f5a0c2f/ab6772690000c46c290beee3ed0d39aed7fa7107?ts=1655426747&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=e56052013ae112a1"}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/exodus"},"data":{"Name":"Exodus","Bio":"There is more than one artist with this name:\n\n1) Exodus is one of the first thrash metal bands to come out of the bay area, formed in 1980 in San Francisco, California, by Kirk Hammett, Tom Hunting, Paul Baloff, Jeff Andrews, and Gary Holt.\n\nThey were cited as major influence by pretty much every thrash band.
