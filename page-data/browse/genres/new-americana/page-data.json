For the album, the GRAMMY</span><span>&reg;</span><span> Award-winning quintet&mdash;Andy Falco [guitar], Chris Pandolfi [banjo], Andy Hall [dobro], Jeremy Garrett [fiddle], and Travis Book [double bass]&mdash;expanded their signature sound by perfecting their seamless fusion of All-American-bluegrass and rock.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Once again sail into uncharted territory moored only by their expressive patchwork of All-American bluegrass threaded together with strands of rock, jazz, funk, country, old-time, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As they approached this latest body of work, the group&rsquo;s ambition matched their outsized creative curiosity.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Rise Sun</span><span> was sparked by the feeling of wanting something better for the world&mdash;more love, more awareness, and more compassion,&rdquo; says Hall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a message of taking care of each other, our planet, and ourselves. We all shared this feeling as evidenced by the songs we brought to the project. It&rsquo;s the feeling of a rising sun as opposed to a dark night. Sometimes a message of hope is less popular than one of despair, but it&rsquo;s much-needed nevertheless.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It&rsquo;s also a message that 13 years, eight studio projects, and nearly 1,000 shows prepared the boys to properly present.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Infamous Stringdusters stand out as the rare group who whose dynamic musicianship can be showcased with contemporary artists on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert one night and jamming on the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre alongside The Grateful Dead&rsquo;s Phil Lesh the next.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Engendering a sense of impassioned fandom, they band have attracted a faithful audience that continues to grow. Moreover, their powerful music and performances paved the way for a GRAMMY</span><span>&reg;</span><span> Award win in the category of &ldquo;Best Bluegrass Album&rdquo; for 2017&rsquo;s </span><span>Laws of Gravity</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When it came time to record what would become </span><span>Rise Sun</span><span>, they pushed themselves to evolve once more.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Rise Sun</span><span> is the latest chapter in the progression of our sound,&rdquo; says Pandolfi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long arc that includes evolution on all fronts&mdash;writing, arranging, performing, and maybe most importantly, growing as humans who have more to say as the journey rolls on. New albums are the time when we write and introduce our strongest original material. On our last release </span><span>Laws of Gravity</span><span>, we really started to hit our stride with recording live in the studio. </span><span>Rise Sun</span><span> is another big step in that direction.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For the first time, the band chose the song order before actually recording. Additionally, they maintained that order throughout the process, recording the songs in sequence which resulted in a natural flow. This choice, &ldquo;gives it the feeling of a story as you listen down,&rdquo; says Hall. It represented a moment of collective confidence.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;We self-produced the last album, so we felt validated in a sense that our instincts were sound,&rdquo; adds Book. &ldquo;We came into this one with some confidence. Any doubts about our band or our mission had dissipated. What remained was a deep sense of purpose and love.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;The GRAMMY</span><span>&reg;</span><span> put some high-octane gas in our tanks as well,&rdquo; grins Garrett. &ldquo;We also wanted to rise to the challenge of making a follow-up project worthy of what we had done in the past.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Infamous Stringdusters introduce the album with the handclap-driven gallop of the title track &ldquo;Rise Sun.&rdquo; High energy banjo powers an uplifting and undeniable refrain that immediately shines.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hopeful anthem,&rdquo; Book elaborates. &ldquo;The sun is rising, and the light is overtaking the darkness. The idea for the melody, inspired by Southern gospel music, came to me driving out of the mountains into Georgia from my home in North Carolina. When we wrote it, I was feeling a deep sense of hope for humanity that the sun will rise again.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Then, there&rsquo;s the hummable instrumental &ldquo;Cloud Valley,&rdquo; which exudes a sci-fi spirit of wonder via sonic intricacy. &ldquo;Science fiction can transport you to a place of deep imagination,&rdquo; says Pandolfi. &ldquo;We wanted to generate a soundscape for an imaginary mystical setting. It really came alive when we all got together.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Everything culminates on a heartfelt send-off with &ldquo;Truth and Love.&rdquo; Its delicate musical backdrop transmits an important statement for The Infamous Stringdusters.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;I wrote that a few years ago and brought it back now, because I feel like the message has become more relevant today,&rdquo; Falco states. &ldquo;The world is polarized. Everything is so extreme, and partisan politics have become a culture war. The song is a reminder of what&rsquo;s truly important in life&mdash;seek the truth, find your love, look up high, and aim above. Life is short, so keep your eye on what&rsquo;s important while you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In the end, that&rsquo;s precisely what The Infamous Stringdusters do on </span><span>Rise Sun</span><span> as they boldly welcome yet another new day, new phase, and new chapter.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a brotherhood, but that family extends beyond the band even,&rdquo; Falco leaves off. &ldquo;Our music gives us an opportunity to bring some light in a world that can be dark sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<div><span><br /></span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Bluegrass","Jam Band","New Americana","Instrumental Bluegrass","Neo Traditional Bluegrass","Jamgrass","Mandolin","Progressive Bluegrass","Jamgrass"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ec83c2ad60139e2286d3aa748cdba915/6bcbeee5/the-infamous-stringdusters_05-30-19_20_5cf0251c3b332.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/my-morning-jacket-12-29-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-30T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"My Morning Jacket","Subtitle":null,"Description":"<div><span>Back in 2014, the members of My Morning Jacket spent time up in Stinson Beach, a tiny Northern California town set right on the ocean and near the majestic Muir Woods. Massively inspired by their idyllic surroundings&mdash;and a sense of charmed isolation that frontman Jim James likened to &ldquo;living on our own little moon&rdquo;&mdash;the Kentucky-bred five-piece ended up creating over two dozen songs at the mountaintop studio known as Panoramic House. Though they flirted with the idea of putting out what would have been a triple album, the band ultimately decided that less would be more at the time and divided the project into two halves, releasing the first segment as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall</em>: a 2015 full-length that earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. My Morning Jacket are now set to share the second half of the project as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II</em>, an unforeseen and timely continuation of a psychic and sonic journey begun long ago.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>As James reveals, the decision to unearth&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>was sparked from a bit of serendipity in the early days of self-quarantine. While out on a walk, he placed his music library on shuffle and soon stumbled upon &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo; a tender rumination on the struggle for presence, its lyrics confessing to feeling &ldquo;hypnotized from doing the same old thing.&rdquo; Struck by the song&rsquo;s enduring relevance, James revisited the other tracks reserved from the Panoramic House sessions and found that they invited a welcome moment of self-reflection&mdash;an outcome perhaps even more perfectly suited to the chaos of the current day than the circumstances of their recording.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>mines its mood of dreamy contemplation from certain heartbreak James had recently experienced, including the demise of a monumental relationship. Unfolding in a loosely threaded narrative of loss and recovery, the album conjures an indelible pain but never drifts into despair, gracefully conveying James&rsquo;s message that &ldquo;there is hope beyond the pain and loss, if you learn to flow with life like water.&rdquo;</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Opening with the profound reverie of &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>endlessly illuminates My Morning Jacket&rsquo;s eclectic sensibilities, encompassing everything from lilting sunshine-pop to fantastically ramshackle rock and roll. While the album slips into heavenly psychedelia on tracks like &ldquo;Feel You&rdquo; (a mesmerizing epic James developed deep in the Muir Woods), a more ominous tone permeates &ldquo;Magic Bullet&rdquo; and its rattled response to gun violence. An intimate documenting of keeping an open heart in the face of devastation,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>embodies a wistful longing on &ldquo;Run It&rdquo; (a song about &ldquo;the desire to disappear and turn back into water,&rdquo; according to James) and later gives way to overwhelming gratitude on &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; (a portrait of &ldquo;coming home from tour feeling so sad and defeated and lonely, but realizing how much love I was lucky to have in my friends and family&rdquo;). And on &ldquo;The First Time,&rdquo; My Morning Jacket close out the album with a sweetly rambling meditation on the possibility of finding love again, channeling both ineffable sorrow and wide-eyed hope to incredibly glorious effect.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Even in its most heavy-hearted moments,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>radiates an undeniable sense of wonder, a testament to the wild-mindedness that&rsquo;s long imbued the music of My Morning Jacket. With their unabashed curiosity infinitely stirred by their time at Stinson Beach, the band hopes that the album might lead others to look beyond what&rsquo;s human-made in the search for solace and renewal. &ldquo;As so many of us feel out of tune and long for the world to be a better place, we have to look to nature and the animals and learn from them: learn to love, accept, move on, and respect each other,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;We gotta work for it and change our ways before it&rsquo;s too late, and get in harmony with love and equality for all of humanity and for nature too.</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7de0016072c5e08b3111d18f27348b21/29018e11/my-morning-jacket-tickets_12-29-21_18_61094f2b86142.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/my-morning-jacket-12-30-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-31T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"My Morning Jacket","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/346db64309e9f0e8749923baf5d24d02/cb0694bf/cc81d18c-d94e-4d9a-8627-d8109b6e55b0_1437431_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"genre":"New Americana","genreRegex":"/New Americana/gi","today":"2021-10-29T00:47:42.516Z","slug":"/browse/genres/new-americana"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
