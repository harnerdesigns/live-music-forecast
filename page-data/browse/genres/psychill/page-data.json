Joining solid groove with sounds of serenity, their signature aesthetic feels as natural on the dance floor as it does after hours or on the mat.  Due in no small part to Desert Dwellers’ pioneering spirit, the very concept of chill-out and sacred bass music has expanded dramatically. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Desert+Dwellers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Number_Of_Events":null,"SpotifyFollowers":86857,"Genres":["World Fusion","Psychill"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7c537f5a36b980e592c91b041afabae4/ac356205/ab6761610000e5eb36ebfe3b69bcdb637dda32b1"}]}}}]},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/beats-antique-11-05-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-06T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Beats Antique","Subtitle":"with Desert Dwellers, Bluetech, and Edamame","Description":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s impossible to describe Beats Antique using just a single genre. One listen to their&nbsp;</span>forthcoming album, Shadowbox (released on their own Beats Antique Records imprint),&nbsp;and their unique hybrid of sound makes perfect sense; their ability to blend so many&nbsp;different kinds of music in to an incredibly vibrant, distinctive and peerless album is what&nbsp;this band has been doing for the past ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Based in Oakland, California, Sidecar Tommy, David Satori and Zoe Jakes make up&nbsp;</span>Beats Antique, who released their 10th album on October 5th 2016 to commemorate their&nbsp;tenth year as a band. They&rsquo;ve mounted a larger-than-life cross-country tour that will take&nbsp;their vision to theaters across America. &ldquo;Shadowbox is both the title of our new album, the&nbsp;theme of our tour, and our new store front in Berkeley CA. We decided to bring it all&nbsp;together on this release.&ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Mostly recorded at their studio in Oakland (which has been around since the 50s), the&nbsp;</span>Bay Area band also recorded in Russia and Israel. &ldquo;We were lucky to record in both&nbsp;Moscow and Tel Aviv, because we had shows there and wanted to connect with the local&nbsp;artists. We had amazing sessions in both locations; In Moscow we recorded on the&nbsp;outskirts of the city in a wild Industrial complex. We ended up going through strange&nbsp;corridors into this plush bamboo-floored-Hare-Krishna-owned recording studio with state&nbsp;of the art gear. When we were in Tel Aviv, we gave a call to a local legend Yossi Fine and&nbsp;he helped us get time at Pluto Studios, which is one of the best in the city. We recorded&nbsp;with Talya Solan and her amazing group of musicians. We used elements of the Tel Aviv&nbsp;session to create our track &ldquo;Bdna Salam,&rdquo; which is raising money for Syrian refugees.&rdquo;&nbsp;Along with Talya other features on Shadowbox include Lafa Taylor, Alam Khan, Tatiana&nbsp;Kalmykova, brasshouse trio Too Many Zooz (who are touring with Beats Antique),&nbsp;Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dana Elle, Madoline Tasquin and Medium Troy Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox is a retrospective of sorts, with Beats Antique pulling from all of their previous&nbsp;</span>work as almost a homage to the first ten years of their career. &ldquo;This will be our first full&nbsp;album produced in Beats Antique&rsquo;s recording studio/dance performance space. We feel&nbsp;like Shadowbox touches on all our styles from down-temp Middle Eastern influences to&nbsp;cinematic orchestral arrangements. The songwriting process is also different for every&nbsp;song. Sometimes David will come in with a melody and Sidecar will add the bass and&nbsp;beats, and vise versa. One thing that always makes the songwriting process unique is&nbsp;that Zoe creates and arranges music based around stories she wants to tell though&nbsp;dance, so sometimes the performance aspect influences the creation of the music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In June, the group premiered the first single, &ldquo;Killer Bee,&rdquo; featuring Lafa Taylor,&nbsp;</span>on Billboard.com. The track is &ldquo;about standing up to prejudices. Just because someone&nbsp;calls you a killer bee, doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to kill. We want people to define themselves&nbsp;and not be defined by what people think they should be.&rdquo; In addition to being a &lsquo;killer&rsquo;&nbsp;track, with a compelling music video directed by Kyrian Bobeerian, Beats Antique&nbsp;donated a percentage of the proceeds from their July 1st show at Red Rocks&nbsp;Amphitheatre to The Honeybee Conservancy, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness&nbsp;about the importance of bees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>An enthusiastic touring band, a new album also means a new tour, and since Beats&nbsp;</span>Antique is all about the &lsquo;concept,&rsquo; Shadowbox (the album and the idea) is another&nbsp;opportunity for them to get the creative juices flowing for the live shows. The band plan to&nbsp;use shadows, light, Indonesian shadow puppetry, custom-created lanterns, dance, story&nbsp;telling, crowd participation and more to make sure this is an unforgettable visual spectacle&nbsp;for their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox, an album that is an amalgamation of the history of Beats Antique, merged&nbsp;</span>with a tour that will both tease and excite the senses, shows off what this band does best &ndash; transform, innovate and revolutionize what you think you know about music.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["World Fusion","Psychill"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/aee6d0cd852f52fadd396b8a47647958/531612ef/uploadedimage_5df0327046d4e.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"genre":"Psychill","genreRegex":"/Psychill/gi","today":"2021-10-27T13:35:27.187Z","slug":"/browse/genres/psychill"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
