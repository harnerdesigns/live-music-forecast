New albums are the time when we write and introduce our strongest original material.

It represented a moment of collective confidence.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;We self-produced the last album, so we felt validated in a sense that our instincts were sound,&rdquo; adds Book. &ldquo;We came into this one with some confidence.

When we wrote it, I was feeling a deep sense of hope for humanity that the sun will rise again.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Then, there&rsquo;s the hummable instrumental &ldquo;Cloud Valley,&rdquo; which exudes a sci-fi spirit of wonder via sonic intricacy. &ldquo;Science fiction can transport you to a place of deep imagination,&rdquo; says Pandolfi. &ldquo;We wanted to generate a soundscape for an imaginary mystical setting. It really came alive when we all got together.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Everything culminates on a heartfelt send-off with &ldquo;Truth and Love.&rdquo; Its delicate musical backdrop transmits an important statement for The Infamous Stringdusters.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;I wrote that a few years ago and brought it back now, because I feel like the message has become more relevant today,&rdquo; Falco states. &ldquo;The world is polarized.

Blending infectious funk grooves, psychedelic jams, and experimental electronics, the Baltimore four-piece&rsquo;s new album, &lsquo;Pizazz,&rsquo; is a buoyant, blissful reminder of just how much fun music can be. Eschewing the traditional funk band lineup that typically includes keyboards, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong constructs effervescent soundscapes with just two guitars, bass, and drums, crafting their music with a sophisticated ear for both open space and dense layering.</p>\r\n<p>While &lsquo;Pizazz&rsquo; is, in many ways, a familiar continuation of the journey that&rsquo;s earned the band its rapidly expanding and rabidly devoted following (known as The Flock), it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong.

Glide Magazine called Pigeons &ldquo;a band that melts faces and pulls no punches,&rdquo; while C-Ville Weekly praised the growing &ldquo;cult around [their] high-energy music, goofy stage antics, and all around good vibes,&rdquo; and JamBase raved that guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Schon is &ldquo;destined to become one of our generation&rsquo;s finest guitarists.&rdquo; Since the group&rsquo;s inception nearly a decade ago at the University of Maryland (where the band&rsquo;s name came to Ormont and Schon during a moment of transcendence in Psych 100), they&rsquo;ve built up a reputation as one of the most engaging and life-affirming acts on the road, maintaining a relentless tour schedule that has them performing up to 200 shows a year and hitting festivals from coast to coast. The band even founded their own gathering, Domefest, which recently celebrated its eighth year and attracted nearly 2,000 members of The Flock for an immersive weekend of love, music, and community.</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Jam Band"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/21b48634b6f782c53ab588a554fefe34/7608d968/pigeons-playing-ping-pong-tickets_11-13-21_18_60be804b6b78e.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/yonder-mountain-string-band-11-19-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-20T02:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Yonder Mountain String Band","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["String Band","Progressive Bluegrass","Banjo","Jam Band"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c2f6d79ceddf7fb3f3c61d726f4b3706/c0958114/e4d5bf53-fb60-4f83-b7c5-4e50bfcad7c3_1118661_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/pikes-peak-center"},"data":{"Name":"Pikes Peak Center","City":"Colorado Springs"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/goose-11-21-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-22T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Goose","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Jam Band","Jamtronica"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4c4dcfbdd30d77a6b845f51569d2da29/112eaabd/34d07e04-6298-4017-a146-0b0841f82982_1439781_CUSTOM.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-string-cheese-incident-11-26-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-27T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The String Cheese Incident","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Jason Hann &ndash; Percussion\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKyle Hollingsworth &ndash; Keyboards and Vocals\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMichael Kang &ndash; Mandolin, Guitar and Vocals\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBilly Nershi &ndash; Acoustic and Electric Guitar and Vocals\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKeith Moseley &ndash; Bass and Vocals&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\nMichael Travis &ndash; Drums and Vocals\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Over the past decade, The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America&rsquo;s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado&rsquo;s Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 12 albums and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. 2019 marks their 25th&nbsp;year as a band, with a history packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>When The String Cheese Incident&rsquo;s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the Internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<div>Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of &ldquo;making a band.&rdquo; With the Internet as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information online, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base. Rather than doing business on such terms as &ldquo;the bottom line,&rdquo; SCI put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band&rsquo;s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI&rsquo;s &ldquo;On The Road&rdquo; series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the Internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>The String Cheese Incident&rsquo;s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage &ldquo;Green&rdquo; shows and tours. SCI&rsquo;s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and HeadCount. All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances. The list of SCI&rsquo;s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse.

Born in 1993 in Colorado&rsquo;s Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 12 albums and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. 2019 marks their 25th&nbsp;year as a band, with a history packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>When The String Cheese Incident&rsquo;s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the Internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<div>Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of &ldquo;making a band.&rdquo; With the Internet as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information online, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base. Rather than doing business on such terms as &ldquo;the bottom line,&rdquo; SCI put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band&rsquo;s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI&rsquo;s &ldquo;On The Road&rdquo; series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the Internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>The String Cheese Incident&rsquo;s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage &ldquo;Green&rdquo; shows and tours. SCI&rsquo;s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and HeadCount. All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances. The list of SCI&rsquo;s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning&rsquo;s Hideout, and holiday shows such as New Year&rsquo;s and Halloween, have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators.&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In 2017, The String Cheese Incident released \"Believe\" on SCI Fidelity Records, making it the second time the band collaborated with producer Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads.

Massively inspired by their idyllic surroundings&mdash;and a sense of charmed isolation that frontman Jim James likened to &ldquo;living on our own little moon&rdquo;&mdash;the Kentucky-bred five-piece ended up creating over two dozen songs at the mountaintop studio known as Panoramic House. Though they flirted with the idea of putting out what would have been a triple album, the band ultimately decided that less would be more at the time and divided the project into two halves, releasing the first segment as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall</em>: a 2015 full-length that earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. My Morning Jacket are now set to share the second half of the project as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II</em>, an unforeseen and timely continuation of a psychic and sonic journey begun long ago.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>As James reveals, the decision to unearth&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>was sparked from a bit of serendipity in the early days of self-quarantine. While out on a walk, he placed his music library on shuffle and soon stumbled upon &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo; a tender rumination on the struggle for presence, its lyrics confessing to feeling &ldquo;hypnotized from doing the same old thing.&rdquo; Struck by the song&rsquo;s enduring relevance, James revisited the other tracks reserved from the Panoramic House sessions and found that they invited a welcome moment of self-reflection&mdash;an outcome perhaps even more perfectly suited to the chaos of the current day than the circumstances of their recording.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>mines its mood of dreamy contemplation from certain heartbreak James had recently experienced, including the demise of a monumental relationship. Unfolding in a loosely threaded narrative of loss and recovery, the album conjures an indelible pain but never drifts into despair, gracefully conveying James&rsquo;s message that &ldquo;there is hope beyond the pain and loss, if you learn to flow with life like water.&rdquo;</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Opening with the profound reverie of &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>endlessly illuminates My Morning Jacket&rsquo;s eclectic sensibilities, encompassing everything from lilting sunshine-pop to fantastically ramshackle rock and roll. While the album slips into heavenly psychedelia on tracks like &ldquo;Feel You&rdquo; (a mesmerizing epic James developed deep in the Muir Woods), a more ominous tone permeates &ldquo;Magic Bullet&rdquo; and its rattled response to gun violence. An intimate documenting of keeping an open heart in the face of devastation,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>embodies a wistful longing on &ldquo;Run It&rdquo; (a song about &ldquo;the desire to disappear and turn back into water,&rdquo; according to James) and later gives way to overwhelming gratitude on &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; (a portrait of &ldquo;coming home from tour feeling so sad and defeated and lonely, but realizing how much love I was lucky to have in my friends and family&rdquo;). And on &ldquo;The First Time,&rdquo; My Morning Jacket close out the album with a sweetly rambling meditation on the possibility of finding love again, channeling both ineffable sorrow and wide-eyed hope to incredibly glorious effect.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Even in its most heavy-hearted moments,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>radiates an undeniable sense of wonder, a testament to the wild-mindedness that&rsquo;s long imbued the music of My Morning Jacket. With their unabashed curiosity infinitely stirred by their time at Stinson Beach, the band hopes that the album might lead others to look beyond what&rsquo;s human-made in the search for solace and renewal. &ldquo;As so many of us feel out of tune and long for the world to be a better place, we have to look to nature and the animals and learn from them: learn to love, accept, move on, and respect each other,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;We gotta work for it and change our ways before it&rsquo;s too late, and get in harmony with love and equality for all of humanity and for nature too.</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7de0016072c5e08b3111d18f27348b21/29018e11/my-morning-jacket-tickets_12-29-21_18_61094f2b86142.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/my-morning-jacket-12-30-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-31T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"My Morning Jacket","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/346db64309e9f0e8749923baf5d24d02/cb0694bf/cc81d18c-d94e-4d9a-8627-d8109b6e55b0_1437431_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/sun-squabi-02-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-05T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"SunSquabi","Subtitle":"The Funk Hunters, Dreamers Delight","Description":"<p>SunSquabi: A Hydro Funk Experience</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a place, deep in the cosmos, where jam bands and electronic dance music intersect with rhythm-driven funk.
