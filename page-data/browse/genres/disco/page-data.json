The song, a U.S. #1 single and million-seller that's still a radio staple, is considered one of the earliest disco songs. Some authorities proclaim it to be the first disco song to hit #1, while others grant that distinction to \"Love's Theme\" by the Love Unlimited Orchestra, a chart-topper from earlier in 1974. The Hues Corporation has played on into the new millennium, although facing many challenges. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hues+Corporation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Number_Of_Events":null,"SpotifyFollowers":37500,"Genres":["Disco"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/687f16eeb9c3b884095f8ce58f73b198/ef4f7776/9c77522265652bfdfd741ba675a7d07ea3323efd"}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/chromeo"},"data":{"Name":"Chromeo","Bio":"Chromeo is an electrofunk duo based in Montreal, Canada and New York City.
