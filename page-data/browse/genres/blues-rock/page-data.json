Massively inspired by their idyllic surroundings&mdash;and a sense of charmed isolation that frontman Jim James likened to &ldquo;living on our own little moon&rdquo;&mdash;the Kentucky-bred five-piece ended up creating over two dozen songs at the mountaintop studio known as Panoramic House. Though they flirted with the idea of putting out what would have been a triple album, the band ultimately decided that less would be more at the time and divided the project into two halves, releasing the first segment as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall</em>: a 2015 full-length that earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. My Morning Jacket are now set to share the second half of the project as&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II</em>, an unforeseen and timely continuation of a psychic and sonic journey begun long ago.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>As James reveals, the decision to unearth&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>was sparked from a bit of serendipity in the early days of self-quarantine. While out on a walk, he placed his music library on shuffle and soon stumbled upon &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo; a tender rumination on the struggle for presence, its lyrics confessing to feeling &ldquo;hypnotized from doing the same old thing.&rdquo; Struck by the song&rsquo;s enduring relevance, James revisited the other tracks reserved from the Panoramic House sessions and found that they invited a welcome moment of self-reflection&mdash;an outcome perhaps even more perfectly suited to the chaos of the current day than the circumstances of their recording.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>mines its mood of dreamy contemplation from certain heartbreak James had recently experienced, including the demise of a monumental relationship. Unfolding in a loosely threaded narrative of loss and recovery, the album conjures an indelible pain but never drifts into despair, gracefully conveying James&rsquo;s message that &ldquo;there is hope beyond the pain and loss, if you learn to flow with life like water.&rdquo;</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Opening with the profound reverie of &ldquo;Spinning My Wheels,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>endlessly illuminates My Morning Jacket&rsquo;s eclectic sensibilities, encompassing everything from lilting sunshine-pop to fantastically ramshackle rock and roll. While the album slips into heavenly psychedelia on tracks like &ldquo;Feel You&rdquo; (a mesmerizing epic James developed deep in the Muir Woods), a more ominous tone permeates &ldquo;Magic Bullet&rdquo; and its rattled response to gun violence. An intimate documenting of keeping an open heart in the face of devastation,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>embodies a wistful longing on &ldquo;Run It&rdquo; (a song about &ldquo;the desire to disappear and turn back into water,&rdquo; according to James) and later gives way to overwhelming gratitude on &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; (a portrait of &ldquo;coming home from tour feeling so sad and defeated and lonely, but realizing how much love I was lucky to have in my friends and family&rdquo;). And on &ldquo;The First Time,&rdquo; My Morning Jacket close out the album with a sweetly rambling meditation on the possibility of finding love again, channeling both ineffable sorrow and wide-eyed hope to incredibly glorious effect.</span>\r\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span>Even in its most heavy-hearted moments,&nbsp;<em>The Waterfall II&nbsp;</em>radiates an undeniable sense of wonder, a testament to the wild-mindedness that&rsquo;s long imbued the music of My Morning Jacket. With their unabashed curiosity infinitely stirred by their time at Stinson Beach, the band hopes that the album might lead others to look beyond what&rsquo;s human-made in the search for solace and renewal. &ldquo;As so many of us feel out of tune and long for the world to be a better place, we have to look to nature and the animals and learn from them: learn to love, accept, move on, and respect each other,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;We gotta work for it and change our ways before it&rsquo;s too late, and get in harmony with love and equality for all of humanity and for nature too.</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7de0016072c5e08b3111d18f27348b21/29018e11/my-morning-jacket-tickets_12-29-21_18_61094f2b86142.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/my-morning-jacket-12-30-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-31T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"My Morning Jacket","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Blues Rock","Roots Rock","Stomp And Holler","Jam Band","Indie Folk","Indie Rock","Melancholia","Alternative Rock","New Americana"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/346db64309e9f0e8749923baf5d24d02/cb0694bf/cc81d18c-d94e-4d9a-8627-d8109b6e55b0_1437431_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/beth-hart-the-thankful-tour-02-07-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-08T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Beth Hart: The Thankful Tour","Subtitle":null,"Description":"<p>Beth Hart is on fire. Right now, the Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter is riding a creative tidal wave, firing out acclaimed albums, hooking up with the biggest names in music and rocking the house each night with that celebrated burnt-honey voice. In 2016, the headline news is Beth&rsquo;s latest album, Fire On The Floor (out 14 October 2016 (Europe / Australia / New Zealand) and 3 February 2017 (US / Canada) on Provogue/Mascot Label Group): a release that even this fiercely self-critical artist describes as &ldquo;pretty frickin&rsquo; good&rdquo;. But let&rsquo;s not forget the backstory that brought her here&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>The Blues Magazine once dubbed Beth Hart &ldquo;the ultimate female rock star&rdquo;, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that her two-decade career is the ultimate thrill-ride. Born in Los Angeles, she released a fistful of hit albums through the &rsquo;90s, then reignited in the post-millennium as both a solo artist and the head-turning vocalist for guitar heroes like Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and Slash. &ldquo;Extraordinary,&rdquo; wrote The Times of her once-a-generation voicebox, while The Guardian praised her &ldquo;daring, brooding and angry&rdquo; performances. It&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s been nominated for three Blues Music Awards.</p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s in recent times that Beth has truly blossomed. In April 2015, she released Better Than Home: a critical and commercial smash that topped the iTunes Blues Chart and was crowned #4 Best Blues Album Of The Year by Mojo magazine. The release led her to fill Amsterdam&rsquo;s Heineken Music Hall with 5,500 fans (her largest club show to date). &ldquo;Oh, that was so good, man,&rdquo; she reflects. &ldquo;I love Holland. They&rsquo;ve been really good to me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The US has embraced her, too, packing ever-larger venues in major cities on the Better Than Home tour &ndash; including Nashville&rsquo;s iconic Ryman Auditorium &ndash; and receiving a nomination from the American Blues Foundation in the category of Contemporary Blues Female Artist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;This last tour, we were playing much bigger houses than I&rsquo;d ever played in the States &ndash; and they were sold-out.&rdquo; Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Beth&rsquo;s rocketing UK profile has never been higher. Recent years have seen auspicious headline sets at the Royal Albert Hall and the Barbican (not to mention the historic Hampton Court Palace with Joe Bonamassa), and in December 2015, she chalked up another first with a spot on Jools Holland&rsquo;s legendary annual Hootenanny.</p>\r\n<p>Bringing in the New Year with a soulful take on Tell Her You Belong To Me and Nutbush City Limits alongside long-time collaborator Jeff Beck, it spoke volumes that the pair&rsquo;s performance rapidly became the Hootenanny&rsquo;s most-watched clip on the BBC&rsquo;s official YouTube channel (even overtaking heavyweights like Tom Jones and Paul Weller). &ldquo;Every time Jeff performs, he just kills it,&rdquo; gushes Beth, who also joins the veteran guitarist for her first-ever appearance at the Hollywood Bowl this year. &ldquo;To me, he&rsquo;s the greatest ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Just as memorable, also last December, was Beth&rsquo;s first solo gig at London&rsquo;s Union Chapel (subsequently voted by fans as the venue&rsquo;s gig of the year). &ldquo;It was the most terrifying experience of my entire life,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I got up there and I was so frickin&rsquo; scared. But then, halfway through the show, I just started to enjoy it. By the end, I felt so connected to the audience, and I really felt like they did that show with me. It was like we were all the band.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fire On The Floor is sure to build on her breakneck momentum. The record gave her an emotional release following the bitter-sweet sessions for Better Than Home. Fire On The Floor is the album that Beth Hart needed to make. Likewise, it&rsquo;s a record that you need to hear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased with it,&rdquo; she concludes. &ldquo;I recently had to organise the sequence of the record, and while I was doing that, I was thinking to myself, &lsquo;Y&rsquo;know, this is pretty frickin&rsquo; good&hellip;!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Beth Hart is going on an extensive tour that will pack houses all over the world. Time and time again Beth has sold out venues in cities as New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Berlin, Milan, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Tbilisi, Sydney and Melbourne.</p>\r\n<p>But maybe her greatest live performance to date was seen by millions of television viewers, when her tribute to Buddy Guy on the Kennedy Center Honors Special received one of the only 2 standing ovations of the evening, led by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.</p>\r\n<p>Every live performance gets a standing ovation, because no one knows how to rock the house better than Beth Hart.
