You&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;re floating here but not lost completely to the atmospheric elements. Instead, you&rsquo;re tethered to an avant-garde spaceship with Colorado-based SunSquabi on the frequency. This cosmic wonderland is a melting pot of a variety of musical genres and it represents the future of music.</p>\r\n<p>A three-piece suit - SunSquabi has been catching the eyes and ears of music fans around the world with their ever-evolving sound in the studio and on the live stage. SunSquabi has gained national attention for their unique way of producing music. The band&rsquo;s live show can be described as an &lsquo;Electronic Hydro Funk Experience&rsquo; that is different every single time out. SunSquabi continues to break down and analyze the expectations of what a &ldquo;Live-Electronic&rdquo; band should be. The band unveiled their debut EP with All Good Records, titled, &lsquo;Odyssey&rsquo; which featured artists GRiZ and Dominic Lalli of Big Gigantic. Their 2nd EP &lsquo;Deluxe&rsquo; was a sophomore success with the label that continued where Odyssey left off. The band has now released 2 singles &lsquo;Just A Little&rsquo; and &lsquo;Caterpillar&rsquo; ahead of their upcoming 2018 release.</p>\r\n<p>Combining the talents of Kevin Donohue (guitars/keys/production) Josh Fairman (bassist/synth) and Chris Anderson (drums). This project is a disciplined and structured group. It takes a seasoned musician to stay in the pocket for the sake of building well-developed lines and climaxes. To do that seamlessly requires patience and skill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda like breathing, honestly. We can communicate directly with each other both verbally and non-verbally, onstage and off.&rdquo; That connection will take the music collectively where we all want to go.&rdquo; &ndash; Kevin Donohue</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Livetronica","Jamtronica","Jam Band","Canadian Electronic"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/33fc412218fc0fff2a780349cc454e96/1d0e285a/sunsquabi-tickets_02-04-22_18_613bdc997b2cd.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"genre":"Canadian Electronic","genreRegex":"/Canadian Electronic/gi","today":"2021-11-17T06:19:55.847Z","slug":"/browse/genres/canadian-electronic"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
