BIG DAD RITCH captains this pirate ship of bikers, outlaws, troubadours, and hellraisers, welcoming all comers to the THC party with gregarious charisma and Southern charm. Across a half dozen albums, countless club gigs, and show stealing performances at Rockstar Mayhem, THC has spread the good word of big riffs, big hooks, and wild times. High in the Saddle is a record full of unashamed, full-throttle ass kicking. Its the bands second pairing with producer Bob Marlette (Black Stone Cherry, Rob Zombie) and sixth album over all, on the heels of the No. 2 Billboard Heatseekers slab, Dark Side of Black .

They take their name from the roadway that links their hometown of Lake Jackson, Texas to Galveston, where the cops, the teachers, the baristas and the chemical plant workers travel to work hard and to play hard, blowing off steam, dancing to their favorite bands. Blue Water Highways music is the soundtrack for their lives.Best Friend is the first single from their upcoming album Heartbreak City, coming out on Blue Water Highway Records/Thirty Tigers on June 8th. With a hook thats a mile wide, it chronicles the lives, loves and friendships that sustain us. Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, We wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into that feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another. Even though I wrote characters that are not the band members, our relationship definitely informed the writing of the lyrics.Blue Water Highway was started by two best friends from high school -Kibodeaux (lead vocals, guitar) and Greg Essington (guitar). They were later joined by Catherine Clark (keyboards), Jared Wilson (drums) and Kyle James Smith (bass). They will be touring relentlessly to support Heartbreak City, so look for them in a town near you soon.
