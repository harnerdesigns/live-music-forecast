Aside from decades spent delivering high-octane performances with his larger-than-life persona in IRON MAIDEN, Bruce has lived an extraordinary off-stage existence too.

Split into two parts, the first section of the show sees Bruce taking a humorous and often satirical look at the world from his own very personal perspective, treating the audience to private insights into his drive and ambition, peppered with plenty of Maiden anecdotes, and a myriad of other experiences encompassing not just the giddy heights but also the extreme lows,.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-20-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b5f864614a137d3d07c1218ac72036a7/f2619665/49e5d728-8bb1-4a7a-bdbc-d5181cb5017b_1545321_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Paramount Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Paramount Theatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/zomboy-02-20-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-21T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Zomboy","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"02-20-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Brostep"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/zomboy"},"data":{"Name":"Zomboy"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3ed366f232b3cf2292eb8e1ee44155a1/55a2b4e7/cd8453cb-d664-47f4-abae-3362808f80b7_893831_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/zomboy-02-20-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-21T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Zomboy","Description":"Originally from a background of more traditional sound engineering, running his own recording studio, recording bands and artists, and gaining a following in America with his solo project \"Place Your Bet$\", it was when he moved to Guildford, UK to study a degree in Music production at the ACM that he discovered a new love for electronic music.&nbsp; Zomboy sites influences such as Skrillex, Reso, Rusko, and Bare Noize as the reason he wanted to dominate the dubstep scene. <br /><br />And dominate he has.
