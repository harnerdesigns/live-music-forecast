Brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters understand one another at the purest level. When families rally around music, they speak this oft-unspoken bond aloud and into existence. After 25 years, twelve albums, four GRAMMY Award nominations, and sold out shows everywhere, North Mississippi Allstars open up their world once again on their thirteenth album, SetSail [NewWestRecords], welcoming other family (by blood and by the road) into the fold. As legend has it, Luther and Cody Dickinson started the band in 1996 as a loose collective of like-minded second-generation musicians who shared a local repertoire and regional style. Over the years, the lineup shifted by design, and each subsequent record offered up a different combination of collaborators. This time around, they mined the talents of Jesse Williamson bass and Lamar Williams, JR. on vocals. During the Allman Betts Band Family Revival, the Dickinsons first linked up with Lamar, son of the Allman Brothers bassist Lamar Williams, Sr., becoming fast friends and collaborators and eventually paving the way for Set Sail.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-31-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/north-mississippi-allstars"},"data":{"Name":"North Mississippi Allstars"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c81fee8f93fd704338b932f70da302af/103760a6/2c20d0e9-ad0c-4502-b3c6-59e8e8015cd8_1194461_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1656550082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b53a6215da099cfb"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/jack-johnson-w-ziggy-marley-08-31-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-01T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Jack Johnson w/ Ziggy Marley","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-31-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/jack-johnson"},"data":{"Name":"Jack Johnson"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/af8ca203bfddb27eb54cc58929d65011/a589a978/561dce80-9954-4f6d-8b8f-84ece7dc14f2_1722241_ARTIST_PAGE_3_2.jpg?ts=1656550082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cf1578ebdf30d863"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/fiddlers-green-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/north-mississippi-allstars-with-uncle-jesse-dj-set-08-31-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-01T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"North Mississippi Allstars (with Uncle Jesse DJ Set)","Description":"North Mississippi AllstarsDOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, March 31st - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, April 1st - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, July 14th - 10:00amMollys Spirits VIP Lounge: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the Mollys Spirits VIP Lounge.
