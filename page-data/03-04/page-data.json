When describing the music of The Ghost of Joseph Buck, fans often say its like being on a road trip across the American West stretching from the Great Plains to the cactus-filled deserts on our Southern border. Indeed, their songs evoke old Hollywoods Western film landscapes with Spaghetti Western trumpet, the occasional accordion, and low vocals that harken to places where the devils not a stranger. Despite the bands heavy Southwestern influences, the bands sound fuses together the essence of the places theyve been and the place in which they reside. Being that the founding members are midwesterners who came to Colorado with a lust for adventure, the West is still a romantic idea, a place of inspiration. The roots of The Ghost of Joseph Buck were planted in the early 2000s when Joe Franzen (guitar) and Polly Beck (vocals and keyboard) met, quit their jobs, and traveled to South America. Within the next few years, they got married and continued to wander the world soaking in musical influences along the way. With the inspiration of having a full band, they got together with friends and bought bassist Stephanie Schooley an upright for her 30th birthday. Schooley played in a youth orchestra growing up in Austin, TX, and it didnt take long for her to start collaborating with Beck and Franzen. In 2011, they officially became The Ghost of Joseph Buck. They immediately went into Mighty Fine Productions in Denver and cut their first self-titled EP, The Ghost of Joseph Buck. They followed that debut effort with their second EP, Scenic, in 2015. The current line up for the band includes Christine Palmer on trumpet, who brings years of professional musicianship and a Masters Degree in Trumpet performance and Tony Corona on drums, who comes to the band with decades of percussion under his belt along with a background in music production. Franzen writes the majority of music for the band with Beck frequently collaborating and occasionally bringing her own songs to the bands set list. With musical backgrounds in rock, classical, folk, and classic country and strong influences from travels at home and abroad, the bands sound has grown into the likes of a mashup of Calexico, Giant Sand, Cat Power, Ennio Morricone, and Neil Young. Although the mythos of the American West has a strong presence in many of their songs, pigeonholing the band into a specific genre is challenging. As quoted in The Denver Posts Steal This Track, The Ghost of Joseph Buck peppers simple yet strong music with Western motifs like a barroom piano, stand up bass, and mariachi horns but also bring along the ballsiness of rock with guitar moments that almost cross over into hard rock All this talk about the West will likely lead you to expect something specific, but The Ghost of Joseph Buck do well avoiding outright nostalgia and cliche. The West is an inspiration, a launching point and not a handbook for the bands music. The Ghost of Joseph Buck has been hiding out at the Keep Recording Studio in Denver and are set to release their first LP, Until it Ends, in the Fall of 2020. Having played festivals such as the UMS and FoCoMX, live radio shows, and having shared the stage with various bands from Liz Cooper and The Stampede to The Moondoggies, Low Cut Connie, and Bob Log III, The Ghost of Joseph Buck is looking forward to emerging from quarantine and bringing their haunting sound to listeners in live venues.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-04-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/the-ghost-of-joseph-buck"},"data":{"Name":"The Ghost of Joseph Buck"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ee7bb4e747227f98ac1b5d2dad5cd868/e6938be2/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/g-love-special-sauce-03-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-05T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"G Love & Special Sauce","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-04-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cdfcbe795b882a61b995fc025329bd34/40561ab2/6e92a91e-2f32-4047-b331-2f384fa8a3c8_575151_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Aggie Theater"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/aggie-theater"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Aggie Theater"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/boris-03-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-05T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Boris","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-04-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5afc82c7fd7f88bf1ea3ced0a72ced5f/15b2e9a9/33babb6d-5d56-4054-86c5-61b0a65c6ad4_1220301_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/boris-brejcha-03-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-05T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Boris Brejcha","Description":"<div>Born in 1981, Boris Brejcha started his musical education in his childhood.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>His first two releases in 2006,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Monster&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yellow Kitchen&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;were released on the Berlin label Autist Records. A few EPs later, Boris moved from Autist Records to Harthouse. With tracks like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Die Maschinen Sind Gestrandet&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Lost Memory&rdquo;</em>, he combined his unique sound with a maximum of varieties. Consequently, he became the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;exceptional Talent 2007&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in the electronic music magazine Raveline. Boris also created his second alias called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;ANNA&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2007 and had some groundbreaking releases on Autist Records.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>After four years of touring, three albums and lots of singles, Boris became a constant favorite in today's club scene. With his ambition and desire for new and experimental musical directions, he shows his audiences over and over again how exciting minimal techno can be - so much more than just a conglomerate of repetitive and puristic elements.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris created his own music genre&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;High-Tech Minimal&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in 2012 which has often been referred to as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;the intelligent music of tomorrow&rdquo;</em>. After seven years of working together with Harthouse and his fourth album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Feuerfalter&rdquo;</em>, Boris founded his own label called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Fckng Serious&rdquo;</em>. Together with his best friends Ann Clue and Deniz Bul they want to spread their idea of good music and serious parties around the globe.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In the beginning of 2016, Boris came up with his 5th album called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;22&rdquo;</em>. His unbelievable passion for music combined with the longtime experience as a producer for different genres fuses into this exclusive distinctive and very special sound. Beside that, Boris created his own&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha In Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;show which he first played in Brazil in 2016. These events, a combination of synced visuals, his Joker mask and his music, are a special and unique experience.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 2017, Fckng Serious was the first electronic music label to do a Europe Bus Tour with the full crew travelling on a Nightliner through Europe to play 10 shows in 12 days. Like Rockstars!\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Just a year later we also saw Boris making his much-anticipated debut at Tomorrowland, the Exit Festival as well as the legendary Time Warp. A second sold-out bus tour, this time through France, proved to be successful yet again. In General, things didn't get any slower but even bigger than ever before.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Boris&rsquo; success story received a further boost in 2019. He already enjoys a superstar status around the world, but that&rsquo;s not enough yet. He sold out huge clubs in the USA within minutes and almost everyone knows him. It is impossible to imagine the techno scene without him and he has earned his place there. Many new singles appeared in 2019 and the number of his listeners spoke volumes. Since 2019 Boris is also under contract with the well-known label&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ultra Music</em>&rdquo;. His music has also been played on the radio. With his specially created&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Boris Brejcha in Concert&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;shows, he filled huge halls with up to 15,000 people without any problems.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>In 2020, his success story begins even more promisingly than in the previous year. He started the year with a long-awaited album&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Space Diver&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and he has already had a talk show appearance on German television. His name already adorns numerous line-ups of the most famous festivals around the world. USA, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia are just a few of the countries where Boris will be performing again this year. Besides a documentary about his life, we can look forward to many new surprises this year.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-04-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/boris-brejcha"},"data":{"Name":"Boris Brejcha"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/90b3837573af56e4408dbb80b12a9b27/9800591c/boris-brejcha-tickets_03-04-22_18_6125260391b79.jpg"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/justin-martin-03-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-05T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Justin Martin","Description":"Show 9:00PM | Doors 10:00PM | 18+ \n\nEvent tickets purchased for shows in The Perplexiplex DO NOT include admission to the Meow Wolf exhibit.

Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.”\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do...’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”\n","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"03-04-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/justin-martin"},"data":{"Name":"Justin Martin"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a168e5bc17b8c164ebd7a7f583454f57/5bfc7445/d376e7fa-071b-fa53-98c5-990edcfa7ff6"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"03-04-2022","today":"2022-02-09T12:14:32.688Z","slug":"03-04"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
