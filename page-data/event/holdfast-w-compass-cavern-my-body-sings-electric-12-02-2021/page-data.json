Initially a recording project for the songs of Chris Ash, the group started playing live shows and gaining attention from students. They ended the year by opening for DePaul University's \"FEST\", a live concert headlined by Ludacris where they opened for Guster. Since then, they have released their debut EP Like the Sun, which chronicles their early growth as a band and provides a glimpse into the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Holdfast\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/38e657544f5642ca46bc9a36bf04b85a/6bf63df9/ab67616d0000b2737692c3af40a861238d349057"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/larimer-lounge"},"data":{"Name":"Larimer Lounge","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-01-03T18:19:44.058Z","slug":"/event/holdfast-w-compass-cavern-my-body-sings-electric-12-02-2021","nexttitle":"Noah Kahan","nextslug":"noah-kahan","prevtitle":"Willi Carlisle w/ Johno Leeroy + Dylan Earl","prevslug":"willi-carlisle-w-johno-leeroy-dylan-earl"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
