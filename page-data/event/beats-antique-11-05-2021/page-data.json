One listen to their&nbsp;</span>forthcoming album, Shadowbox (released on their own Beats Antique Records imprint),&nbsp;and their unique hybrid of sound makes perfect sense; their ability to blend so many&nbsp;different kinds of music in to an incredibly vibrant, distinctive and peerless album is what&nbsp;this band has been doing for the past ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Based in Oakland, California, Sidecar Tommy, David Satori and Zoe Jakes make up&nbsp;</span>Beats Antique, who released their 10th album on October 5th 2016 to commemorate their&nbsp;tenth year as a band. They&rsquo;ve mounted a larger-than-life cross-country tour that will take&nbsp;their vision to theaters across America. &ldquo;Shadowbox is both the title of our new album, the&nbsp;theme of our tour, and our new store front in Berkeley CA. We decided to bring it all&nbsp;together on this release.&ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Mostly recorded at their studio in Oakland (which has been around since the 50s), the&nbsp;</span>Bay Area band also recorded in Russia and Israel. &ldquo;We were lucky to record in both&nbsp;Moscow and Tel Aviv, because we had shows there and wanted to connect with the local&nbsp;artists. We had amazing sessions in both locations; In Moscow we recorded on the&nbsp;outskirts of the city in a wild Industrial complex. We ended up going through strange&nbsp;corridors into this plush bamboo-floored-Hare-Krishna-owned recording studio with state&nbsp;of the art gear. When we were in Tel Aviv, we gave a call to a local legend Yossi Fine and&nbsp;he helped us get time at Pluto Studios, which is one of the best in the city. We recorded&nbsp;with Talya Solan and her amazing group of musicians. We used elements of the Tel Aviv&nbsp;session to create our track &ldquo;Bdna Salam,&rdquo; which is raising money for Syrian refugees.&rdquo;&nbsp;Along with Talya other features on Shadowbox include Lafa Taylor, Alam Khan, Tatiana&nbsp;Kalmykova, brasshouse trio Too Many Zooz (who are touring with Beats Antique),&nbsp;Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dana Elle, Madoline Tasquin and Medium Troy Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox is a retrospective of sorts, with Beats Antique pulling from all of their previous&nbsp;</span>work as almost a homage to the first ten years of their career. &ldquo;This will be our first full&nbsp;album produced in Beats Antique&rsquo;s recording studio/dance performance space. We feel&nbsp;like Shadowbox touches on all our styles from down-temp Middle Eastern influences to&nbsp;cinematic orchestral arrangements. The songwriting process is also different for every&nbsp;song. Sometimes David will come in with a melody and Sidecar will add the bass and&nbsp;beats, and vise versa. One thing that always makes the songwriting process unique is&nbsp;that Zoe creates and arranges music based around stories she wants to tell though&nbsp;dance, so sometimes the performance aspect influences the creation of the music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In June, the group premiered the first single, &ldquo;Killer Bee,&rdquo; featuring Lafa Taylor,&nbsp;</span>on Billboard.com. The track is &ldquo;about standing up to prejudices. Just because someone&nbsp;calls you a killer bee, doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to kill. We want people to define themselves&nbsp;and not be defined by what people think they should be.&rdquo; In addition to being a &lsquo;killer&rsquo;&nbsp;track, with a compelling music video directed by Kyrian Bobeerian, Beats Antique&nbsp;donated a percentage of the proceeds from their July 1st show at Red Rocks&nbsp;Amphitheatre to The Honeybee Conservancy, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness&nbsp;about the importance of bees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>An enthusiastic touring band, a new album also means a new tour, and since Beats&nbsp;</span>Antique is all about the &lsquo;concept,&rsquo; Shadowbox (the album and the idea) is another&nbsp;opportunity for them to get the creative juices flowing for the live shows. The band plan to&nbsp;use shadows, light, Indonesian shadow puppetry, custom-created lanterns, dance, story&nbsp;telling, crowd participation and more to make sure this is an unforgettable visual spectacle&nbsp;for their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shadowbox, an album that is an amalgamation of the history of Beats Antique, merged&nbsp;</span>with a tour that will both tease and excite the senses, shows off what this band does best &ndash; transform, innovate and revolutionize what you think you know about music.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/aee6d0cd852f52fadd396b8a47647958/531612ef/uploadedimage_5df0327046d4e.jpg"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":["World Fusion","Psychill"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/desert-dwellers"},"data":{"Name":"Desert Dwellers","Bio":"Bringing the electronic bass music vibe to the yoga scene, and the sounds of yoga to the electronic dance scene, Desert Dwellers’ global sounds are the bridge between worlds.
