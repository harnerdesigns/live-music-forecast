People frequently refer to their style as being \"avant-pop.\" They are noted for the use of vintage keyboard instruments like Moog synthesizers and Vox and Farfisa organs. Stereolab is also notable for founding their own record label, Duophonic Records, with a grant from UK charity The Prince’s Trust. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5dc4740d1e12c6198a70e4e22fd3111a/e19a930d/ab6761610000e5ebce71a14e2327722a8ed5245c?ts=1657414692&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7e40ee4fa19eb285"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ogden-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Ogden Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-10T00:58:18.335Z","slug":"/event/stereolab-09-13-2022","nexttitle":"Full of Hell w/ Blood Incantation","nextslug":"full-of-hell-w-blood-incantation","prevtitle":"Greensky Bluegrass","prevslug":"greensky-bluegrass"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
