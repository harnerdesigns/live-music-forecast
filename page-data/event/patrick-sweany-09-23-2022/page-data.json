In his early years, Sweaney stuck around his native Ohio, but in 2006 he signed a deal with Nine Mile Records. From that point forward, he recorded regularly, slowly building up a fervent following.\n\nBorn on April 26, 1974 in Massillon, Ohio, a small town 20 miles south of Akron, Patrick Sweany turned professional in the late '90s. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Sweany\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d3e5a57471428c9dc38df19e3fcdc057/deee6d0d/ab6761610000e5eb04cb85131587509a0dc3f891?ts=1657347362&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d1db39c5f25bb0e9"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-09T06:16:09.821Z","slug":"/event/patrick-sweany-09-23-2022","nexttitle":"Big Gigantic","nextslug":"big-gigantic","prevtitle":"Anberlin","prevslug":"anberlin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
