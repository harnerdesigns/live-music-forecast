Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.”\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do...’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”\n","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a168e5bc17b8c164ebd7a7f583454f57/5bfc7445/d376e7fa-071b-fa53-98c5-990edcfa7ff6"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/justin-martin"},"data":{"Name":"Justin Martin","Bio":" Info taken from residentadvisor.net\n\nThere's a new breed of house music bubbling under in a certain American city, but it's not coming out of Chicago or New York - this time it's from San Francisco.
