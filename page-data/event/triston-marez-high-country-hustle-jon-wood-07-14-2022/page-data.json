Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0fc381f38358bec0a4eb90cbd11363cb/528efcd9/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1658624349&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=04a848beb8b899be"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/vultures"},"data":{"Name":"Vultures","City":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-24T00:59:21.886Z","slug":"/event/triston-marez-high-country-hustle-jon-wood-07-14-2022","nexttitle":"We Are William, Intrinsic Gray, Dimensions","nextslug":"we-are-william-intrinsic-gray-dimensions","prevtitle":"We Are William, Dimension, Knife In Hand, When Darkness Falls","prevslug":"we-are-william-dimension-knife-in-hand-when-darkness-falls"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
