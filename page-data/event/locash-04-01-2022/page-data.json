The only four(-ish) songs they ever made, were recorded somewhere over the summer of 2005 (one, their \"hit\" Beauty, was done with the help of Jack, from Woodrow). They were active from March till November of 2005, but split up when they realized they were getting on each others nerves instead of making actual progress. Their songs remain available for download from the band's MySpace. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/LoCash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a4a8752dd7c33f6bdb15a91e5d7152f6/fb6d2452/ab6761610000e5eb092666738941b1220b149d93?ts=1649464756&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7896b141ba9db4ac"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/grizzly-rose"},"data":{"Name":"Grizzly Rose","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-04-09T00:39:21.983Z","slug":"/event/locash-04-01-2022","nexttitle":"Denzel Curry","nextslug":"denzel-curry","prevtitle":"Los Canarios, Banda Movil, Los Morros Del Norte","prevslug":"los-canarios-banda-movil-los-morros-del-norte"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
