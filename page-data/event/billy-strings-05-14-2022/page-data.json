Strings deals in acoustic music, but his lyrics are rooted in contemporary issues (\"Dust in a Baggie\" sounds like a classic bluegrass breakdown, but the lyrics deal with crystal meth addiction), and the music reinforces this fusion of past and present, melding modern melodic frameworks with fiddles and banjos. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Strings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c81332dacb7d4cff5fd2d44f8e432e97/72c5ece8/ab6761610000e5eb5e3f5f359d5c09b68b03761a?ts=1655727575&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=bd7bcf6035b4f3bf"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-06-20T12:19:40.763Z","slug":"/event/billy-strings-05-14-2022","nexttitle":"D.R.I.","nextslug":"d-r-i","prevtitle":"6 Million Dollar Band","prevslug":"6-million-dollar-band"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
