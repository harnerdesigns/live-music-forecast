A few years later Fela Kuti came calling. Kaleta would go on to tour the world playing guitar for the King of Afrobeat in his storied band Egypt 80 through the 1980s and into the 1990s.Now based in New York City, Kaleta has been leading Super Yamba Band since 2017. Their debut album Mdaho, which was released by California indie label Ubiquity Records, draws on the groups shared reverence for the raw, psychedelic sounds that captivated Kaleta as a music loving kid in 1970s Benin. Mdaho means big brother, elder or teacher and is dedicated to Kaletas late brother Ligan-Ozavino Pascal who introduced him to funk and soul music at a very early age. The album was included on Bandcamps Best Albums of Summer 2019 list and two of the songs were chosen for the ABC/Hulu series High Fidelity staring Zoe Kravitz.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4aecd4ee8b4a6b724b014adfb065deac/53b5c672/5fefbd1c-973b-4b0e-9b2e-d78e4ce37548_106111_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1658600198&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=33076095bb67c620"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-23T18:16:51.620Z","slug":"/event/kaleta-super-yamba-band-with-zanib-08-13-2022","nexttitle":"Black Pistol Fire","nextslug":"black-pistol-fire","prevtitle":"Slightly Stoopid","prevslug":"slightly-stoopid"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
