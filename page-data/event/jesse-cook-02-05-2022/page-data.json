He composed his first album, Tempest, over 25 years ago. Jesse could not imagine that such a humble recording, in which he played all the instruments, would spark into a music legacy with thousands of concerts performed around the world, over 2 million albums sold, 5 PBS TV specials, and millions of content views and streams across the internet. Jesse and his extraordinary band are looking forward to returning to the road, bringing the Tempest Tour II and their unique brand of rhythm and rhumba to audiences across North America in 2022.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1e46c7b0765c23409d273317e34b1c9f/230638c1/61fe47fc-4580-4a3e-9d52-44fd451d7759_129711_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Paramount Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2021-10-26T15:57:22.141Z","slug":"/event/jesse-cook-02-05-2022","nexttitle":"Josh Abbott Band","nextslug":"josh-abbott-band","prevtitle":"No Mana at Temple Denver","prevslug":"no-mana-at-temple-denver"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
