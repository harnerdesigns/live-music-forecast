The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e61619d4463d05e4cc10ae54d444661b/f43e68c7/ab6761610000e5eb7ef3783488fcf0dab0708970?ts=1656516851&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=fac38f340c52dbb6"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gerald-ford-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Gerald Ford Amphitheatre","City":"Vail"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-06-29T15:34:16.974Z","slug":"/event/fitz-and-the-tantrums-08-17-2022","nexttitle":"The Teaches of Peaches Anniversary Tour","nextslug":"the-teaches-of-peaches-anniversary-tour","prevtitle":"Sanguisugabogg, Undeath, No/Mã¡S","prevslug":"sanguisugabogg-undeath-no-ma-s"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
