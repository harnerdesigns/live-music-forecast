And with the second half of the band&rsquo;s third studio album, PLUMP , on the horizon, the band&rsquo;s career continues to catapult forward. Buoyed by the generous support of 359 Kickstarter donors, the 27-song album does more than showcase the group&rsquo;s beautiful music, but also tells an important story, comprised in PLUMP Chapters 1 &amp; 2 .</p>\r\n<p>Recorded during a two-year span with legendary producer Ron St. Germain, PLUMP serves as a reflection of four brothers&rsquo; triumphs and struggles, both individual and as a whole. On Chapter 1, songs like &ldquo;Lost in the Cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every Soul&rdquo; detail what it&rsquo;s like to hit rock bottom and how to rise back up.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;So many fans have shared how these songs carried them through very difficult times, and that alone makes this all worth it,&rdquo; said Brook Jordan, Twiddle&rsquo;s percussionist and vocalist. Comparatively, Chapter 2 contains genre-bending instrumentals, as well as mystifying epics like &ldquo;Nicodemus Portulay&rdquo; and &ldquo;Orlando&rsquo;s.&rdquo; More than ten years later, these songs mirror the earliest Twiddle arrangements of 2004-2005 when Mihali Savoulidis and Ryan Dempsey were collaborating in their freshmen dorms at Castleton State College. The completion of PLUMP is timely, coming at a moment when the band&rsquo;s fervent fan base is at an all-time high and expanding rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>Comparatively, Chapter 2 contains genre-bending instrumentals, as well as mystifying epics like &ldquo;Nicodemus Portulay&rdquo; and &ldquo;Orlando&rsquo;s.&rdquo; More than ten years later, these songs mirror the earliest Twiddle arrangements of 2004-2005 when Mihali Savoulidis and Ryan Dempsey were collaborating in their freshmen dorms at Castleton State College.
