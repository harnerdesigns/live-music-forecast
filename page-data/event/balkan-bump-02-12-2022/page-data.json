Balkan Bump debuted with the single “Aymo” alongside superstar collaborators Gramatik and Talib Kweli. Gramatik quickly championed the new project; unveiling Balkan Bump's live show on his Re: Coil Tour and releasing Balkan Bump’s debut EP on his Lowtemp label imprint in 2018. Balkan Bump then blossomed to international audiences, performing at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lightning In A Bottle and Electric Forest, and releasing collaborations with CloZee, Beats Antique, The Gift Of Gab, The Geek x Vrv, Fakear, and more. Musically, Balkan Bump is a fusion of live instruments, world influences and lush electronic production. His releases flaunt experience as an instrumentalist and arranger, fusing energetic Balkan brass with heavy electronic production and hip-hop influences.\n\n<H3> ETHNO (Jeff Franca of Thievery Corporation) </H3>\n\nIntroducing ETHNO, the latest in sonic explorations from Denver based drummer/producer, Jeffrey James Franca.\n\nHeavily influenced by his love for global rhythm, ETHNO embodies the spirit and soul of Jeffrey's musical diversity. Widely known as the drummer for electronic music pioneers Thievery Corporation, Jeff brings new life, and a modern sound to the timeless experience of terrestrial vibration. You will find a vast array of influence from Africa, Asia, Caribbean and South America in the rhythms and melodies, along with lush textures and thumping bass to massage all your chakras, head to toe.\n\nListeners will feel the time that he has spent traveling the globe with Thievery Corporation, within the ethereal worldly approach that leaps forth decades to create a genuine future world music sound. ETHNO shows feature a driving mix of danceable global-electro sounds, blended with live percussion to create a unique sonic exploration that has moved crowds across the country.\n\nHaving recently collaborated with Gravitas and Westwood Recordings as a remixer, the debut EP of ETHNO is due out later this year. ETHNO truly reflects Jeffrey's philosophy on life and music. \"We are all connected, rhythmically, sonically and spiritually. Life is fun, music is fun, and we can connect people and cultures through our most joyous contribution, music. One Love\".\n","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/044398d637fb6152cf312ab8e941ca79/77f7fb7f/afb3e831-e8d5-3445-8142-550e7b99f52c?ts=1652163289&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6de99bc8a7f2f225"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/balkan-bump"},"data":{"Name":"Balkan Bump","Bio":"Trumpet player, producer and ethnomusicologist <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Balkan+Bump\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3afa81bfea839620d30bfa1d06f71aeb/254cf966/ab6761610000e5eb30e28c4f244e34e3dc5c40a1?ts=1652163291&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cab861e2a5a6ddca"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-05-10T06:14:57.509Z","slug":"/event/balkan-bump-02-12-2022","nexttitle":"Slenderbodies","nextslug":"slenderbodies","prevtitle":"Koffin Kats, Reno Divorce, the Dead End","prevslug":"koffin-kats-reno-divorce-the-dead-end"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
