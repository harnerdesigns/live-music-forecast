Formed by Jadran (lead guitar) and Mario (drums), two cousins with a passion for true heavy metal and thrash, Exmortus quickly took shape and began playing their first shows that same year. With influences ranging from Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer, Exmortus immediately stood out amongst the local Whittier, CA scene, which consisted mostly of nu metal and metalcore bands. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Exmortus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c912b47352911fa56472c80ddea6f049/362f7004/ab6761610000e5eb581a27c8c30d6d2cac49c6cb?ts=1658451478&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=bd9d7e51fe73b916"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/marquis-theater"},"data":{"Name":"Marquis Theater","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-22T00:58:05.234Z","slug":"/event/exmortus-07-10-2022","nexttitle":"The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band (with the Claudettes)","nextslug":"the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-with-the-claudettes","prevtitle":"Nick Waterhouse","prevslug":"nick-waterhouse"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
