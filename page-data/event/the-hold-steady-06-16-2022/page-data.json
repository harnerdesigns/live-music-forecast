Wanting to capture the sound of bands such as The Replacements and The Grifters, Finn recruited guitarist Tad Kubler (also ex-Lifter Puller), drummer Judd Counsell, and bassist Galen Polivka. In 2005 the band grew to include Franz Nicolay (of The World/Inferno Friendship Society) on keyboards and Bobby Drake took over on drums following Counsell's departure.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Hold+Steady\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/91575ba88a77fb02c4b0099a11bde656/5215f7ac/ab6761610000e5ebcaea8a31ec5e165b98d5d948?ts=1653353456&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=b2c79a4bd8aeb937"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bluebird Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-05-24T00:51:02.248Z","slug":"/event/the-hold-steady-06-16-2022","nexttitle":"Chicago and Brian Wilson with Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin","nextslug":"chicago-and-brian-wilson-with-al-jardine-and-blondie-chaplin","prevtitle":"Jon Wolfe","prevslug":"jon-wolfe"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
