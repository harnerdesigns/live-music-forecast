The group consists of Peter Murphy (vocals), Daniel Ash (guitar), Kevin Haskins (drums), and David J (bass). The band was originally named Bauhaus 1919 after the German art movement until they dropped the numerals within a year of formation. They combined a number of influences (punk, glam rock, funk, and dub) to create a very dark but very passionate sound, appealing to many looking for something new after punk. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bauhaus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1f38004931381ab76c7671eb52ed8f11/659f7007/9676688ae196b8abf4ed89ce6620a7ad04027095?ts=1656723578&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=336b0918777ccfcd"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-02T00:59:47.592Z","slug":"/event/bauhaus-09-26-2022","nexttitle":"Matt Nathanson","nextslug":"matt-nathanson","prevtitle":"Julia Jacklin","prevslug":"julia-jacklin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
