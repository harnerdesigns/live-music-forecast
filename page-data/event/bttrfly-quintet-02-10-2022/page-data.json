A group of highly regarded musicians across America and the world that reside in Denver who bonded together during the 2020 pandemic to create music that satisfied their love for adventurous, improvisational futuristic soul jazz.\n\nIndividually, the members of the quintet have won Grammy’s, garnered multiple Grammy nominations, charted billboard on several occasions, collaborated on platinum records, played some of the top festivals and venues in North America, as well as performed across the planet.\n\nThe QUINTET will be coming together officially for the first time for their Meow Wolf performance before making their festival debut at Florida’s Brainquility Festival. The group has further grabbed fans attention by prefacing they have an album to be released in 2022\n\n<H3> Dandu </H3> \n\nDandu’s music is hard to categorize, with ever-expanding influences that range from jazz to metal, electronica to classical, and beyond. The trio’s sound is fueled by complex, well thought out arrangements that leave room for moments of true spontaneity. The mission of the music is to take you on a journey through shifting scenes, evoke a range of emotion, and keep you endlessly surprised by what comes next. The sound of this democratic outfit is made up of the deep pocket and melodic style of bassist Sean Dandurand, the masterfully polyrhythmic and endlessly modulating grooves of drummer Dylan Johnson, and the vast textures and swirling soundscapes of synthesist/keyboardist Ben Weirich. Dandu has played across the US, at iconic venues like Webster Hall, Chautauqua Auditorium, Paradise Rock Club, and more. The trio has shared the stage with Thundercat, Jacob Collier, Louis Cole, John Scofield, John Medeski, Victor Wooten, Tera Melos, and many more.
