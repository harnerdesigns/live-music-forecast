The group formed in 2009 while members Rob Grote, Mark Larson, Connor Jacobus, and Braden Lawrence were all still in high school. The prolific young band released its first EP, Kitchen Songs, in 2011 followed by Telephone, its debut full-length, the following year. The Districts' second EP, the more acoustic-leaning While You Were in Honesdale, was released in late 2012 and the band continued to perform regionally. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Districts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/32ee75952dc41f933cd10031955cebd0/9a5d0f94/ab6761610000e5eb59a0199d4ddede017d70c259"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bluebird Theatre","City":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-03-28T06:14:07.500Z","slug":"/event/the-districts-03-18-2022","nexttitle":"The Stubby Shillelaghs, The Constant Tourists, Bolonium","nextslug":"the-stubby-shillelaghs-the-constant-tourists-bolonium","prevtitle":"Elle King","prevslug":"elle-king"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
