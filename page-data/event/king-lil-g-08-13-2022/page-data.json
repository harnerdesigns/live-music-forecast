Inspired by their lyrics, beats and style, King Lil G became motivated to write lyrics of his own at the age of 12. He never thought of pursuing music as a career, but while growing up around his two older brothers, whom he saw as role models, King Lil G learned everything he needed to know about surviving in the streets. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Lil+G\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c3f836d71eb20bb4cc166dadf9bf23c1/30356ede/ab6761610000e5eb607aabc9bcd03dd778339a6f?ts=1658297781&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=ae5288b90d204aa0"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/summit"},"data":{"Name":"Summit","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-20T06:16:28.455Z","slug":"/event/king-lil-g-08-13-2022","nexttitle":"Aaron Carter","nextslug":"aaron-carter","prevtitle":"Kristin Chenoweth","prevslug":"kristin-chenoweth"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
