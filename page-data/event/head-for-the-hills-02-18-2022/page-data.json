The material reflects both the turbulent social rhythms of our current era and more timeless moments of joy, growth, and change.\n\nLike a painter that starts in acrylic and graduates to oils, Head for the Hills is deeper and richer in their 15th year as a band, with a wider palette of sonic textures at their disposal.  Dorm room jam sessions have turned into a decade plus on the road--from humble coffee shops to theaters, festivals, roadhouses and clubs all across the country. Over time those sounds and influences have crept more and more into the bluegrass beginnings of the band, morphing into the seasoned eclecticism of Say Your Mind. The new songs are quinnessential Head for the Hills; genre-stradling, lyrically deep, and danceable, with a crew of collaborators bringing the best of Colorado acoustic, roots, and soul music together. \n\nHead for the Hills numerous festival appearances include notables Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, South by Southwest, FloydFest, RockyGrass, DelFest, Summer Camp Music Festival, WinterWonderGrass Festival, Blue Ox Music Festival, Northwest String Summit, Strawberry Music Festival, Chicago Bluegrass & Blues Festival, Folk Alliance, Grandoozy and many more. The band charted on the CMJ Top 200 twice, has been featured on NPR Ideastream and eTown, and was awarded Best Bluegrass in Colorado four times via Denver’s Westword Magazine. \n\n<H3> The Cody Sisters </H3> \n\nThe Cody Sisters Band is the very heart of contemporary acoustic music in Colorado, the United States, and the UK.
