Originally from Tennessee, Fuel moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs. Their first EP Porcelin was released in 1996, and sold well locally, spawning a small radio hit with \"Shimmer.\" The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their second EP, Hazelton, the following year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fuel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5dde77996bc19b89f8b5867c41063bc1/b0f8f8b7/ab6761610000e5ebc4d87957588c1e6462156d40?ts=1658624350&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=426095388626c3ba"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-amphitheater-at-philip-s-miller-park"},"data":{"Name":"The Amphitheater at Philip S.
