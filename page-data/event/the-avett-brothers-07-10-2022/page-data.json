Two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. Subsequently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a4999aedb82a956155bd875df4f99258/40cfbcff/ab6761610000e5eb11fdd42d6e75eda65cc1f19d"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-02-10T00:31:01.624Z","slug":"/event/the-avett-brothers-07-10-2022","nexttitle":"Kenny G","nextslug":"kenny-g","prevtitle":"Kenny G","prevslug":"kenny-g"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
