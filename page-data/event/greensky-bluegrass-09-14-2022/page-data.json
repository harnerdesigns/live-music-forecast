The band has evolved over the years, growing from 3 to 5 members and describe their sound as \"their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll\".\n\nThe band was formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), who initially played together at an open mic night. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f73f49419e89018713a8835d9e48f937/a66bf64d/ab6761610000e5eb24debcb38288279852ae5431?ts=1657327495&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=ace9ea1e4296bae4"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/dillon-amphitheater"},"data":{"Name":"Dillon Amphitheater","City":"Dillon"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-09T00:45:00.428Z","slug":"/event/greensky-bluegrass-09-14-2022","nexttitle":"Stereolab","nextslug":"stereolab","prevtitle":"Miss May I","prevslug":"miss-may-i"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
