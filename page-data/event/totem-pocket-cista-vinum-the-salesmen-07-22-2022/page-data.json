Members are Aesop Adams on lead guitar and vocals, Aaron Dooley on bass and vocals, Chris Sparks on rhythm guitar, and Dan Somerville on Drums. Their solo efforts hailed by Record Crates United as psychedelic down to its very DNA and the definition of cosmic music respectively, childhood friends Adams and Dooley moved to Denver in 2017, where they met locals Sparks and Somerville. Combining their loves for deep-end psych and emo-hardcore, Totem Pocket creates music that swerves between atmoshpheric tranquility and total sonic warfare. Currently, the band is recording their debut album while playing shows throughout Colorado.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c7f55ebfb858eac1c3037c67d757118/765357b3/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1658816239&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=9da2186daf288d57"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-26T06:17:26.742Z","slug":"/event/totem-pocket-cista-vinum-the-salesmen-07-22-2022","nexttitle":"TX2","nextslug":"tx-2","prevtitle":"Blackhawk","prevslug":"blackhawk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
