They came together at school as teenagers when Justin Currie (bass and vocals), James Scobbie (guitar and vocals) and Donald Bentley (guitar) formed a band in reaction against the rest of the 'rockers' in the school. The name was chosen deliberately because it didn't mean anything but sounded a bit like someone's name. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Del+Amitri\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9755eec2bdb1aec71bac0cd53494d601/ca2b83d6/ab6761610000e5ebbc86d5b6764b7a24eff9967b"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gothic-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Gothic Theatre","City":"Englewood"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-02-14T00:30:50.634Z","slug":"/event/del-amitri-04-06-2022","nexttitle":"Gondwana, E.N.
