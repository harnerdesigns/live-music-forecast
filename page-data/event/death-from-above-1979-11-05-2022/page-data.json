Keeler (bass, synths) and Sebastien Grainger (vocals, drums), which formed in 2001. Refusing to employ a lead guitarist, they played loud synth infused dance punk on the drum and bass combination alone.\n\nThey added the 1979 suffix to the name following a legal dispute with New York City dance-punk label Death From Above (known as DFA Records since the September 11, 2001 attacks). \"Death from above\" was written on a helicopter in the movie Apocalypse Now, which was copyrighted in 1979. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Death+from+Above+1979\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/28578c23a238f60a67f7bad0e710f4ed/c59a5304/ab6761610000e5eb564eec26efb2ab29424cba8e?ts=1656550085&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=5511446fbf039c69"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bluebird Theatre","City":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-06-30T00:48:12.388Z","slug":"/event/death-from-above-1979-11-05-2022","nexttitle":"Straight No Chaser","nextslug":"straight-no-chaser","prevtitle":"Kevin Morby","prevslug":"kevin-morby"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
