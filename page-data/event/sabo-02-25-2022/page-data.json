Heavily influenced by a multitude of cultures from around the world, Sabo’s sound holds much of his intrigue. Sabo's productions take you along a journey into sound, a sonic landscape that crosses several musical borders with mixtures of tropical poly-rhythms, warm bass frequencies, rich percussion, lush tribal vocals, and smooth organic textures. When listening you will undoubtedly find yourself resonating with his intention, imagining yourself dancing in an Amazon rainforest or on a desert plane for a Saharan sunrise. Behind the decks, his innovative approach to each DJ set makes him a consistent stand out at Festivals like Coachella, Lightening in a Bottle, Shambhala, Fusion, Symbiosis, Desert Hearts, Further Future, and Burning Man's Robot Heart bus. As a label boss, he is known for his dynamic vision - heading up his imprint label “Sol*Selectas” which is successfully re-defining a new vein of dance music. It was the Top 10 Best Selling Deep House label on Beatport for 2016, with almost every release breaking into the Top 10 charts of their respective genres. The label captures a wide array of sounds, enlisting up and coming underground producers from all over the globe, as well as prominent well known producers in the industry, focusing the sound on deep spiritual dance music, guiding its listeners into the future realm with positive intention.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5921e7accffcd72b23703a7b75b99762/4703b649/339fcb99-a28d-587c-5747-8767740e8f5b"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/convergence-station-meow-wolf"},"data":{"Name":"Convergence Station @ Meow Wolf","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-03-01T18:10:46.416Z","slug":"/event/sabo-02-25-2022","nexttitle":"Indigo Jones, Janae File, Dzirae Gold, Joe Staccs","nextslug":"indigo-jones-janae-file-dzirae-gold-joe-staccs","prevtitle":"Godspeed You!
