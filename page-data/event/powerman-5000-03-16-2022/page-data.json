Two years later, the band moved to Dreamworks (and relocated to Los Angeles), where they released a revamped version of their debut as Mega!! Kung Fu Radio. Tonight the Stars Revolt! Touring with the likes of Marilyn Manson and Korn, as well as a stint on Ozzfest, expanded their fan base and led up to Powerman 5000s 1997 science fiction-esque follow-up Tonight the Stars Revolt! During shows and promos for the album, the band was often found sporting spacesuits and other sci-fi paraphernalia. The record went platinum, helped in part by the success of singles When Worlds Collide and Nobodys Real on MTV.Moxi Theater is operating at Full CapacityReserve a Table in Advance Online.All Responsible Ages Permitted*PHOTO ID REQUIRED FOR ENTRYThe Moxi Theater is proudly partnered with Lunas Tacos s is located at 806 9th St. - next door to the Moxi and is open for Dinner, Happy Hour, and Late Night.
