Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.\n\nThe first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b4456abeae7059e3facb9e6eec501a3b/9cca03e1/ab6761610000e5ebff76ffdcaf85d06eadaf0667"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ogden-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Ogden Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-02-06T18:10:06.449Z","slug":"/event/spiritualized-04-04-2022","nexttitle":"Fletcher","nextslug":"fletcher","prevtitle":"Cobra Man","prevslug":"cobra-man"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
