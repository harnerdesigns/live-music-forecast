Just in time to celebrate our 25th birthday. The band had just released its 12th studio album in January 2020. The Unraveling was mostly recorded in Memphis at Sam Phillips Recording Service nine new songs detailing the horrific state of MAGA America in songs that addressed white supremacy, school shootings and the opioid crisis. The album earned excellent reviews (including later being named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone in France) and we set out on the road playing shows up the east coast including NYC, Boston and DC. Unfortunately, the pandemic happened and we only completed one three-week leg of what was supposed to be a 15-month tour. In lockdown, we all did what we could. Cooley, Jay and I played numerous virtual shows from our respective homes. Matt Patton built up his already successful studio (Dial Back Sound in Water Valley, MS) and album productions including acclaimed records from Bette Smith and Jimbo Mathus. Jay Gonzalez released his third excellent solo album Back to the Hive.Turn it up loud and see you at the Rock and Roll Show,Patterson Hood","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/64b2d71b097d5832e43e39e1dc86c1d7/160542e7/8be3d654-e6e9-411a-9d78-f5e966e012ea_1590991_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1657369082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=3d9bac1f127524a0"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-09T12:18:07.701Z","slug":"/event/drive-by-truckers-with-buffalo-nichols-07-15-2022","nexttitle":"Lava Gato, Lungburn, Ovira, Violence In Violent","nextslug":"lava-gato-lungburn-ovira-violence-in-violent","prevtitle":"Colorado's Finest Underground Hip Hop","prevslug":"colorados-finest-underground-hip-hop"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
