It consists of Alexis Taylor (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Joe Goddard (vocals, synths, percussion), Al Doyle (guitar, vocals), Owen Clarke (synths, guitar) and Felix Martin (percussion). The combination of Taylor's ethereal, high-pitched vocals with Goddard's warm, low pitch and the band's blip-blop electronics creates a dreamy sound. The band is best known for the hit singles \"Over and Over\" (2006) and \"Ready for the Floor\" (2008). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Chip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/56f30e3bb7d78ccc1e83d9df7ecd75fd/f8b7d7ac/ab6761610000e5eb376749e1aa22224aa222d592"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-04-03T06:12:48.166Z","slug":"/event/hot-chip-04-26-2022","nexttitle":"Turnstile","nextslug":"turnstile","prevtitle":"Knocked Loose","prevslug":"knocked-loose"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
