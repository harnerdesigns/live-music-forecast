The current lineup consists of Scott \"Taxi\" McMicken (vocals, guitar), Toby \"Tables\" Leaman (vocals, bass),  Zach \"Text\" Miller (keyboards, guitar), Frank \"Thanks\" McElroy (guitar) and Eric \"Teach\" Slick (drums).\n\n\"There's a little folk, blues, indie rock, soul, bluegrass--and a whole lot of down-home harmonizing.
