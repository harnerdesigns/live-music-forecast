It is difficult to peg her as part of a single musical genre because she loves to experiment with different styles of songwriting. Suffice it to say that Ezra makes up songs and plays them on her acoustic guitar with ferocious energy and gut wrenching sincerity. Her music is derivative of, but never completely part of, a number of musical genres: rock, blues, punk, folk and pop are some prime examples.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ezra+Furman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b15a27354848937bb852839ead5e305f/feee75c4/ab6761610000e5eb21e4c09e30e3272e9732aaae?ts=1655426746&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=00ef305fda4f7642"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gothic-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Gothic Theatre","City":"Englewood"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-06-17T00:45:51.145Z","slug":"/event/ezra-furman-05-28-2022","nexttitle":"Celtic Woman","nextslug":"celtic-woman","prevtitle":"Hayden James - Lifted Tour","prevslug":"hayden-james-lifted-tour"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
