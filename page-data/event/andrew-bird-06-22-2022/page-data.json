He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.\n\nHis early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5a189c15178099712dea4630e4cf4d0e/28bfe73f/ab6761610000e5eb93219dcf394409eeb54b4c39"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-03-30T18:13:06.485Z","slug":"/event/andrew-bird-06-22-2022","nexttitle":"Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine and Neko Case","nextslug":"andrew-bird-and-iron-wine-and-neko-case","prevtitle":"STRFKR","prevslug":"strfkr"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
