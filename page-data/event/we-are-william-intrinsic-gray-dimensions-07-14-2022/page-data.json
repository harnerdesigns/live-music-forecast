Originally finding its foothold within death metal and thrash influences, the band has since adopted a more eclectic approach to songwriting. Their current influences range from meditative and progressive bands like The Contortionist, Leprous, and Tesseract, to more aggressive and manic acts such as The Faceless and System of a Down. The bands current approach aims to combine these conflicting themes to form a fresh, cohesive and innovative take on progressive metal.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/28e4b0ed00cfd230b45e17dbd7af9512/6a58b92f/5e693c26-2881-4776-8f0c-3aa94bfa3797_106511_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656982329&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d184dcb0999f8be3"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-05T00:52:20.872Z","slug":"/event/we-are-william-intrinsic-gray-dimensions-07-14-2022","nexttitle":"Mandy Moore","nextslug":"mandy-moore","prevtitle":"Triston Marez, High Country Hustle, Jon Wood","prevslug":"triston-marez-high-country-hustle-jon-wood"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
