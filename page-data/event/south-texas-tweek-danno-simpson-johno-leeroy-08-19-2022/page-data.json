The trademark nickname Tweek was given to him after being diagnosed with Tourettes syndrome when he was 9 years old. Tweek draws inspiration from his life, writing alongside his contemporaries, and his South Texas home. Often collaborating with his good friends Charley Crockett and Vincent Neil Emerson, South Texas Tweek has quickly made it clear that he is here to stay in the Texas scene.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1e180716ba146af9867af027da26f447/5df6ec9c/c58dd0af-cda8-49b2-bdaf-068540c3a677_106541_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1658797029&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4aac729005bbd144"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-07-26T00:57:18.162Z","slug":"/event/south-texas-tweek-danno-simpson-johno-leeroy-08-19-2022","nexttitle":"Deca , Homeboy Sandman, Felix Fast4ward","nextslug":"deca-homeboy-sandman-felix-fast-4-ward","prevtitle":"Pitbull","prevslug":"pitbull"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
