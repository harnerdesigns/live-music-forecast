The band's style is most easily described as djent or groove metal with some jazz influence. They use extended polymetric passages, polyrhythmic drum patterns, angular, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. Their lineup has always been consistent, apart from bass which has been handled by many people since the band’s inception. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Meshuggah\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1de96536b11566b23cda4a4082752a96/2f5a0c2f/ab6772690000c46c290beee3ed0d39aed7fa7107"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/fillmore-auditorium-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Fillmore Auditorium (Denver)","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-04-03T18:11:44.262Z","slug":"/event/meshuggah-10-02-2022","nexttitle":"Mother Mother - 2022 Fall Tour USA","nextslug":"mother-mother-2022-fall-tour-usa","prevtitle":"The Airborne Toxic Event","prevslug":"the-airborne-toxic-event"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
