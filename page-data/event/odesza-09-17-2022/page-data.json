They met their senior year of college and decided to spend the summer as recent graduates from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA collaborating on an album. On September 5th, 2012 they self-released a free LP entitled “Summer’s Gone”, creating a delicate balance between dreamy sun trickled melodies, glitched out vocals, crunchy drums and large sweeping basslines. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Odesza\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6516e1cf652ce97112621ddb66294da3/f5ed3bcb/ab6761610000e5eb1b00f0413d659ee91b505f70?ts=1656522250&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0b6e816e9645e597"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/fiddlers-green-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-06-29T17:04:19.619Z","slug":"/event/odesza-09-17-2022","nexttitle":"ODESZA w/ Sylvan Esso","nextslug":"odesza-w-sylvan-esso","prevtitle":"JD McPherson (with The Patient Zeros)","prevslug":"jd-mc-pherson-with-the-patient-zeros"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
