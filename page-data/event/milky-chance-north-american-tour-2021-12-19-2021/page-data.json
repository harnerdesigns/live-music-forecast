You have that metal wall of Rammstein that sticks in front of most onlookers living outside of their borders, oh and there&rsquo;s Kraftwerk. Who would have imagined a mainstream global success story for two young, German men from a fairly small industrial town named Kassel having a hefty number of Australians 14,000 km&rsquo;s away booking tickets to see them perform live every time they come to town. It&rsquo;s a story of two unlikely lads, but it&rsquo;s also one of two incredibly talented lads that created something different that separates them from any other popular artists you know.\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<div>Milky Chance are Philipp Dausch and Clemens Rehbein. They met at school, growing-up listening to Bob Marley, Hendrix &amp; Red Hot Chilli Peppers to name but a few. Getting together to make music in the early days was less about plotting global success, it was instead more about having fun. One of their first songs, however, quickly changed things - It was Stolen Dance. More specifically it was a unique sounding folktronica song that spanned across most commercial &amp; alternative radio playlists across the globe. That moment they uploaded it to Youtube was about 6 yrs ago, but the fact it&rsquo;s one of the most Shazamed songs of all time tells you all you need to know.","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4947e024626fd72ea3eb5eae9e04a2b9/45f99d97/milky-chance-y-mind-the-moon-tour-2021-tickets_12-19-21_18_6050dd2d4bda9.jpg"}],"Tags":null,"Artist_Genres":["German Pop"],"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/milky-chance"},"data":{"Name":"Milky Chance","Bio":"Milky Chance is a German alternative pop folk rock duo with reggae and electronic music influences made up of Clemens Rehbein as vocalist and musician and Philipp Dausch as DJ.
