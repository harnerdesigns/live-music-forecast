Four good friends that brew a musical alchemy that is song centric with a proclivity to stretch things out and see where the evening leads. Heard across radio waves, through the trees at festivals like Electric Forrest, Firefly, and Telluride Blues this band keeps growing and morphing and wants you in on the ride.Dragondeer has had the pleasure to share the stage with Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, Marcus King, The Revivalists, Shakey Graves, Southern Avenue, Dumpstaphunk, Drive By Truckers, Anders Osbourne, and Jerry JosephDragondeer hit the stage with their thick blues-rock sound. Reminiscent of early Led Zeppelin, The Black Keys, and electric Taj Mahal, the quartet stunned the audience with their hybrid of Mississippi Delta blues and 1960s psychedelic rock. Lead vocalist, guitarist and harmonica player Eric Halborg led the band with a rare ferocity, his deep growl and swampy harmonica blending perfectly with Cole Rudys raw pedal steel playing. Shocking many in attendance and quickly catapulting onto the Denver scene, Dragondeer is a growing force to be reckoned with. - Live For Live MusicMoxi Theater is operating at Full CapacityReserve a Table in Advance Online.All Responsible Ages Permitted*PHOTO ID REQUIRED FOR ENTRYThe Moxi Theater is proudly partnered with Lunas Tacos s is located at 806 9th St. - next door to the Moxi and is open for Dinner, Happy Hour, and Late Night.
