It was formed by Alynda Segarra, a Puerto Rican singer-songwriter from the Bronx, New York, after she had moved to New Orleans in 2007.\n\nAfter leaving home at an early age to travel the country, Segarra eventually settled in New Orleans where she began to perform and record with a revolving cast of musicians.  She released two records (2008's It Don't Mean I Don't Love You and 2010's Young Blood Blues) mostly consisting of delicate folk and country songs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hurray+For+The+Riff+Raff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/940467f262947d7592cf01ea08cb6ce8/d1281ee4/ab6761610000e5ebdb9d5c653adddad3a6893b8e"}]}}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/bluebird-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Bluebird Theatre","City":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY","today":"2022-02-20T18:11:23.239Z","slug":"/event/hurray-for-the-riff-raff-04-06-2022","nexttitle":"Tootsie","nextslug":"tootsie","prevtitle":"Marty Stuart","prevslug":"marty-stuart"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
