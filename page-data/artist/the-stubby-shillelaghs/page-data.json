The Stubbies play high energy, acoustic, Celtic folk.  Going to a Stubbies show is a drinking experience with free shots, tons of table pounding songs, and lots of heckling of the band and audience . So find a DD, toss on your wool cap and sweater, and come join us at the pub!\n\nHailing from Northern Colorado, The Stubby Shillelaghs have their fair share of Celtic roots, but also some nerd roots and (cough) hillbilly roots. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stubby+Shillelaghs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b8c8cb59178e646729fd8d1adbc21997/74b45751/ab6761610000e5eb8575a11891563947cace52c4?ts=1653394781&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=9441466d16a2482c"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Stubby Shillelaghs","today":"2022-05-24T12:19:48.506Z","slug":"/artist/the-stubby-shillelaghs"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
