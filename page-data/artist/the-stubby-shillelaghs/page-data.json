The Stubbies play high energy, acoustic, Celtic folk.  Going to a Stubbies show is a drinking experience with free shots, tons of table pounding songs, and lots of heckling of the band and audience . So find a DD, toss on your wool cap and sweater, and come join us at the pub!\n\nHailing from Northern Colorado, The Stubby Shillelaghs have their fair share of Celtic roots, but also some nerd roots and (cough) hillbilly roots. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stubby+Shillelaghs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b8c8cb59178e646729fd8d1adbc21997/74b45751/ab6761610000e5eb8575a11891563947cace52c4"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-stubby-shillelaghs-the-constant-tourists-bolonium-03-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-19T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Stubby Shillelaghs, The Constant Tourists, Bolonium","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Moxi Theater is operating at Full CapacityReserve a Table in Advance Online.All Responsible Ages Permitted*PHOTO ID REQUIRED FOR ENTRYThe Moxi Theater is proudly partnered with Lunas Tacos s is located at 806 9th St. - next door to the Moxi and is open for Dinner, Happy Hour, and Late Night.
