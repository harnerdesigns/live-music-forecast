The striking vulnerability of &ldquo;ruby insides&rdquo; - &ldquo;If I could, I would let you see through me&rdquo; - charts a course that&rsquo;s both intensely personal and deeply connected to those close to us, our kin whether by nature or nurture. As the ground shifts beneath their feet, WOMB&rsquo;s characters help one another face death, despair, and world-altering discovery with resilience and grace. </span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\" dir=\"ltr\"><br /></span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\" dir=\"ltr\">For all the terrain it encompasses, Womb&rsquo;s quest culminates in &ldquo;stardew&rdquo;, a glittering, transcendent invitation to &ldquo;just be where you are&rdquo; - to experience the kind of powerful peace that can only be found by truly coming home.&nbsp;</span>\r\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Electropop","Art Pop","Indietronica","Metropopolis","Canadian Electropop","Chillwave","Shimmer Pop","Escape Room","Edmonton Indie","Grave Wave","Dream Pop","Alternative R B","Art Pop","Urban Contemporary","R B","Afrofuturism"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d288c033267e23d95c24b8ac894e3409/33fce8b1/uploadedimage_5e4c207d4ebe1.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Dawn Richard","today":"2021-10-27T02:55:31.404Z","slug":"/artist/dawn-richard"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
