Two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. Subsequently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a4999aedb82a956155bd875df4f99258/40cfbcff/ab6761610000e5eb11fdd42d6e75eda65cc1f19d"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-avett-brothers-07-10-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-11T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Avett Brothers","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/43092c2080c8ce7efd8856db1635ca57/de56d3e9/13ea9a5b-6484-4123-a0bb-aa5af08ad289_1449931_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Avett Brothers","today":"2022-02-17T12:14:01.842Z","slug":"/artist/the-avett-brothers"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
