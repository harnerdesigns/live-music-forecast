Two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. Subsequently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a4999aedb82a956155bd875df4f99258/40cfbcff/ab6761610000e5eb11fdd42d6e75eda65cc1f19d?ts=1658643346&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=a74f3c8e1d9d6bdf"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Avett Brothers","today":"2022-07-24T06:15:56.005Z","slug":"/artist/the-avett-brothers"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
