In his early years, Sweaney stuck around his native Ohio, but in 2006 he signed a deal with Nine Mile Records. From that point forward, he recorded regularly, slowly building up a fervent following.\n\nBorn on April 26, 1974 in Massillon, Ohio, a small town 20 miles south of Akron, Patrick Sweany turned professional in the late '90s. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Sweany\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d3e5a57471428c9dc38df19e3fcdc057/deee6d0d/ab6761610000e5eb04cb85131587509a0dc3f891?ts=1656569692&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=14cbc4c4d8b60248"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/patrick-sweany-09-23-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-24T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Patrick Sweany","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Patrick SweanyDOORS OPEN: 6:00pmMEMBER PRESALE: Thursday, May 5th - 10:00amVIP ON SALE: Friday, May 6th - 10:00amGA ON SALE: Thursday, August 4th - 10:00amVIP TICKETS: Everyone over age 6 must have their own VIP ticket to gain entry to the VIP section.
