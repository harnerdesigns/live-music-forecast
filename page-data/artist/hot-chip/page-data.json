It consists of Alexis Taylor (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Joe Goddard (vocals, synths, percussion), Al Doyle (guitar, vocals), Owen Clarke (synths, guitar) and Felix Martin (percussion). The combination of Taylor's ethereal, high-pitched vocals with Goddard's warm, low pitch and the band's blip-blop electronics creates a dreamy sound. The band is best known for the hit singles \"Over and Over\" (2006) and \"Ready for the Floor\" (2008). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Chip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/56f30e3bb7d78ccc1e83d9df7ecd75fd/f8b7d7ac/ab6761610000e5eb376749e1aa22224aa222d592?ts=1650737568&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=e73f5ce750ceca93"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/hot-chip-04-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-04-27T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Hot Chip","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ecbcbe151e8aabdcffe1dde35dc0d3f1/87167432/1de3a326-dac4-4435-97c5-fbd2f028f0dd_1019231_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1650737569&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=03339cac4c3ec3db"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Hot Chip","today":"2022-04-23T18:12:58.044Z","slug":"/artist/hot-chip"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
