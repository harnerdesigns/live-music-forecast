It consists of Alexis Taylor (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Joe Goddard (vocals, synths, percussion), Al Doyle (guitar, vocals), Owen Clarke (synths, guitar) and Felix Martin (percussion). The combination of Taylor's ethereal, high-pitched vocals with Goddard's warm, low pitch and the band's blip-blop electronics creates a dreamy sound. The band is best known for the hit singles \"Over and Over\" (2006) and \"Ready for the Floor\" (2008). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Chip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/56f30e3bb7d78ccc1e83d9df7ecd75fd/f8b7d7ac/ab6761610000e5eb376749e1aa22224aa222d592?ts=1651452406&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4b10f6b80b9ba0b7"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Hot Chip","today":"2022-05-02T00:46:58.317Z","slug":"/artist/hot-chip"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
