With no regard towards towards stylistic boundaries, the sound that emerges from the quartet both live and in the studio is as varied and diverse as the many influences that they adapt from. Their approach and commitment to complementing a distinct genre bending sound to top-notch musicianship has set them apart from many of their contemporaries and keeps music lovers eagerly returning to shows. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dopapod\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8de4257c00de38779c32082098bdacc2/51da651c/ab6761610000e5eb7674738b156aab316da2a79d"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/twiddle-11-06-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-11-07T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Twiddle","Subtitle":"Dopapod","Description":"<p>Vermont-based rock band Twiddle has built an impressive resume spanning Red Rocks to Bonnaroo, and multiple sellouts of historic rock venues including Port Chester, NY&rsquo;s Capitol Theatre, and Washington D.C.&rsquo;s 9:30 Club. And with the second half of the band&rsquo;s third studio album, PLUMP , on the horizon, the band&rsquo;s career continues to catapult forward. Buoyed by the generous support of 359 Kickstarter donors, the 27-song album does more than showcase the group&rsquo;s beautiful music, but also tells an important story, comprised in PLUMP Chapters 1 &amp; 2 .</p>\r\n<p>Recorded during a two-year span with legendary producer Ron St. Germain, PLUMP serves as a reflection of four brothers&rsquo; triumphs and struggles, both individual and as a whole. On Chapter 1, songs like &ldquo;Lost in the Cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every Soul&rdquo; detail what it&rsquo;s like to hit rock bottom and how to rise back up.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;So many fans have shared how these songs carried them through very difficult times, and that alone makes this all worth it,&rdquo; said Brook Jordan, Twiddle&rsquo;s percussionist and vocalist. Comparatively, Chapter 2 contains genre-bending instrumentals, as well as mystifying epics like &ldquo;Nicodemus Portulay&rdquo; and &ldquo;Orlando&rsquo;s.&rdquo; More than ten years later, these songs mirror the earliest Twiddle arrangements of 2004-2005 when Mihali Savoulidis and Ryan Dempsey were collaborating in their freshmen dorms at Castleton State College. The completion of PLUMP is timely, coming at a moment when the band&rsquo;s fervent fan base is at an all-time high and expanding rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>Comparatively, Chapter 2 contains genre-bending instrumentals, as well as mystifying epics like &ldquo;Nicodemus Portulay&rdquo; and &ldquo;Orlando&rsquo;s.&rdquo; More than ten years later, these songs mirror the earliest Twiddle arrangements of 2004-2005 when Mihali Savoulidis and Ryan Dempsey were collaborating in their freshmen dorms at Castleton State College.
