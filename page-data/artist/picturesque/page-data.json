Formed in Lexington, Kentucky, the band is comprised of vocalist Kyle Hollis, guitarists Dylan Forrester and Zach Williamson, and bassist Jordan Greenway. The group got started in 2014 and also included founding members drummer Cole Clark and original bassist Robert Mote, who both parted ways with Picturesque in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Picturesque\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/992cd1c3b7dd551c206d7b4cecc38723/c4f621eb/ab6761610000e5ebeade1271b6ede482cece290d?ts=1656828888&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=59de1f175f5eded0"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/picturesque-07-12-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-13T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Picturesque","Subtitle":null,"Description":"Doors 7:00 PM Show 8:00 PM THIS SHOW IS ALL AGES All support acts and times subject to change","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/067f3aa095506b4883b5247f39d4194f/5133ac5e/eed5597d-31ca-4e62-9c6c-b3f42163782d_1705671_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656828885&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=aff710057ffe5608"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/marquis-theater"},"data":{"Name":"Marquis Theater","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Picturesque","today":"2022-07-03T06:14:57.072Z","slug":"/artist/picturesque"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
