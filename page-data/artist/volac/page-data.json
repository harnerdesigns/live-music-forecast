Their bright visual style is a permanent panama, visor and bright oversize tees. Except for their unique music, they run their original podcast - VOLACAST, in which they invite famous stagemates (AC Slater, Wax Motif, Will Clarke and others). Every podcast comes out with cartoons where the artists and guests appear as freaky characters, which is the main trump that fans really adore for its crazy comicalness.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Volac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Electro House","Deep Groove House","House"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Electro House"}},{"data":{"Name":"Deep Groove House"}},{"data":{"Name":"House"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9e6756b7ea43ef8bd1d0294b22c9f631/c50f9d1b/ab6761610000e5eb5fa23e8b88ae014d65521b6f"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Volac","today":"2021-11-16T12:24:53.391Z","slug":"/artist/volac"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
