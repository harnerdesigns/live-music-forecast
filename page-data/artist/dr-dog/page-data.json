The current lineup consists of Scott \"Taxi\" McMicken (vocals, guitar), Toby \"Tables\" Leaman (vocals, bass),  Zach \"Text\" Miller (keyboards, guitar), Frank \"Thanks\" McElroy (guitar) and Eric \"Teach\" Slick (drums).\n\n\"There's a little folk, blues, indie rock, soul, bluegrass--and a whole lot of down-home harmonizing. It conjures images of old friends sitting on a porch swapping instruments and just letting the tape recorder run.\" - Doug Wallen <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dog\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Stomp And Holler","Indie Pop","Modern Folk Rock","Indie Folk"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Stomp And Holler"}},{"data":{"Name":"Indie Pop"}},{"data":{"Name":"Modern Folk Rock"}},{"data":{"Name":"Indie Folk"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/69f7a1c1e126db032b28a2d02319424a/9b8c5393/ab6761610000e5eb389c0d8696b536d69be924db"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Dr. Dog","today":"2021-10-25T21:35:38.031Z","slug":"/artist/dr-dog"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
