The group's 1962 single for Chess Records, \"I Love You\", was a hit in the U.S., peaking at #22 that year on the Billboard Hot 100. The tune was an amalgam of doo wop and Latin beats, and was co-written by bass Ernest Newsom and the group's manager, Willie Ewing. The group recorded further singles for Chess and American Arts but never returned to the charts, remaining archetypical one-hit wonders. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Volumes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c4df25f06067e585a9cf8952118947b2/b3ca1a4c/ab67616d0000b273d10b09a4c8ada710962668ee"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Volumes","today":"2021-10-27T10:55:33.835Z","slug":"/artist/the-volumes"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
