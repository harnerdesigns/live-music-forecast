Kellersalbums reflect his pursuit to create music that sounds like nothing else. Un-beholden to conventionalism, heseamlessly crossesgenre boundaries. The end product is music that encompasses rock, jazz, funk andbluegrass, and always keeps the audience on their feet. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging liveperformances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage showsare rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself onacoustic guitar, bass, guitar synthesizer and drum samples; a technique called live phrase sampling orlooping.The end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica, a genreKeller jokingly calls acoustic dance music or ADM. Kellers constant evolution has led to numerous bandprojects as well;Keller McCourys, GratefulGospel and More Than A Little to name a few. Keller can be found playing clubs and festivals around the U.S.with these projects throughout the year","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cb8fff67900058e4e45a1e882276c916/72b5ec52/78bf528c-8fbd-43c5-8cb4-f0416144dec9_1110711_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656516851&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=0b243b73d92d7996"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Keller Williams","today":"2022-06-29T15:34:20.303Z","slug":"/artist/keller-williams"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
