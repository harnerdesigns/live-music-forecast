This nonstop world-touring artist found his signature sound through his numerous productions and live sets, all characterized by a melodic style of techno.\n\nThe adventure began in 2007 when he released his first hit \"Air conditionné\", which quickly ranked #1 in Beatport sales – the first of a long series of number ones to come. \nIn 2010, Julian signed with two prestigious labels: Cocoon, on which he released the “Color” EP – its single \"Soho\" ranked #1 in the Beatport Techno Top 100 -, and Plus 8 Records. The same year, the “Techno Corner” EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof's label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (“Stay Down”). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP, ‘Hermanos’ with Plus 8 Records.\n \nIn 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP). One year later, he started the year with two remixes for prestigious artists Deadmau5 & Pan-Pot that both charted #1 in the Beatport Techno Top Ten. They were followed by the excellent “Mad” EP with Form Music. He also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin's renowned label: “Don't Think” EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), “She's Hot” EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track \"Unanswered question\" on Drumcode – which went straight at Number 1 on Beatport.   In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: “Rumble” and “Los Pistolos” EP.\n\nIn 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, “Bird”, on Minus and a remix, “COAR,” commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored. Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released – commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist’s greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport’s monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks: “And We”, “Meteorite”, “Bird” and “Wax”. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. \n\nIn 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, “Destination”, an instant success, followed by two equally successful remixes for Matador & Felix da Housecat, “The Enemy” (Rukus) and « Fuego » for Dubfire & Oliver Huntemann (Senso). One year later, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, “Rolling” and “Space”.\n\nIn 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, “Transmission” LP, also on Drumcode. The album was an early 2019 monstrous hit, generating multiple Beatport chart-toppers and hitting the Top 3 All Genres charts. \n\nThe year 2020 saw another successful release on Drumcode, “Schema” EP, a remix in March for Klaudia Gawlas on Form Music (“Time Loop”) and a long-awaited collaboration EP with POPOF : “Dance Escape” (Filth on Acid), released this Fall.
