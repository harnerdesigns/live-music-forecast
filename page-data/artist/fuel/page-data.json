Originally from Tennessee, Fuel moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs. Their first EP Porcelin was released in 1996, and sold well locally, spawning a small radio hit with \"Shimmer.\" The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their second EP, Hazelton, the following year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fuel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5dde77996bc19b89f8b5867c41063bc1/b0f8f8b7/ab6761610000e5ebc4d87957588c1e6462156d40?ts=1653675283&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=dff2bb020fa9df9f"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Fuel","today":"2022-05-27T18:14:52.529Z","slug":"/artist/fuel"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
