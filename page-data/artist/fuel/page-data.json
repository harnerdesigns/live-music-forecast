Originally from Tennessee, Fuel moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs. Their first EP Porcelin was released in 1996, and sold well locally, spawning a small radio hit with \"Shimmer.\" The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their second EP, Hazelton, the following year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fuel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Pop Rock","Nu Metal","Alternative Rock","Alternative Metal","Rap Rock"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Pop Rock"}},{"data":{"Name":"Nu Metal"}},{"data":{"Name":"Alternative Rock"}},{"data":{"Name":"Alternative Metal"}},{"data":{"Name":"Rap Rock"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e0dfc138b9c8dc8ba668153914370d40/dbe09576/ab6761610000e5ebc4d87957588c1e6462156d40"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Fuel","today":"2021-10-26T11:16:40.123Z","slug":"/artist/fuel"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
