The duo (Dunks & The Outlier) first teamed up because of a mutual love for “Hunting” good music, and today this passion still rings true as they continue to champion the simple but often lost idea that the music itself comes first, regardless of attachments to genre. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Funk+Hunters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Canadian Electronic"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Canadian Electronic"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/13562822bd616be8af62969415dbb643/161b363b/ab6761610000e5ebf7ce457dc1e1b16339c110e2"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/sun-squabi-02-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-05T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"SunSquabi","Subtitle":"The Funk Hunters, Dreamers Delight","Description":"<p>SunSquabi: A Hydro Funk Experience</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a place, deep in the cosmos, where jam bands and electronic dance music intersect with rhythm-driven funk. You&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;re floating here but not lost completely to the atmospheric elements. Instead, you&rsquo;re tethered to an avant-garde spaceship with Colorado-based SunSquabi on the frequency. This cosmic wonderland is a melting pot of a variety of musical genres and it represents the future of music.</p>\r\n<p>A three-piece suit - SunSquabi has been catching the eyes and ears of music fans around the world with their ever-evolving sound in the studio and on the live stage. SunSquabi has gained national attention for their unique way of producing music. The band&rsquo;s live show can be described as an &lsquo;Electronic Hydro Funk Experience&rsquo; that is different every single time out. SunSquabi continues to break down and analyze the expectations of what a &ldquo;Live-Electronic&rdquo; band should be. The band unveiled their debut EP with All Good Records, titled, &lsquo;Odyssey&rsquo; which featured artists GRiZ and Dominic Lalli of Big Gigantic. Their 2nd EP &lsquo;Deluxe&rsquo; was a sophomore success with the label that continued where Odyssey left off. The band has now released 2 singles &lsquo;Just A Little&rsquo; and &lsquo;Caterpillar&rsquo; ahead of their upcoming 2018 release.</p>\r\n<p>Combining the talents of Kevin Donohue (guitars/keys/production) Josh Fairman (bassist/synth) and Chris Anderson (drums). This project is a disciplined and structured group. It takes a seasoned musician to stay in the pocket for the sake of building well-developed lines and climaxes. To do that seamlessly requires patience and skill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda like breathing, honestly. We can communicate directly with each other both verbally and non-verbally, onstage and off.&rdquo; That connection will take the music collectively where we all want to go.&rdquo; &ndash; Kevin Donohue</p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":["Livetronica","Jamtronica","Jam Band","Canadian Electronic"],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/33fc412218fc0fff2a780349cc454e96/1d0e285a/sunsquabi-tickets_02-04-22_18_613bdc997b2cd.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Funk Hunters","today":"2022-01-11T18:20:41.445Z","slug":"/artist/the-funk-hunters"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
