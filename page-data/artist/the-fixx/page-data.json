Envisioned by college friends Cy Curnin (vocals) and Adam Woods (drums), the pair soon placed an ad for additional members. Jamie West-Oram (guitar), Rupert Greenall (keyboards) and Charlie Barret (bass) joined the band as a result. Barret left after the first album and was replaced by Dan K. Brown. The Fixx are perhaps best remembered for their song \"One Thing Leads To Another\", from what has been their most successful album, 1983's 'Reach the Beach'. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fixx\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/16bba6d68844a474c160cc3588c38097/bf3f7e57/ffe135656dfe7ccddcf326250346ff81a8a1b4e8"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Fixx","today":"2021-10-25T20:01:18.981Z","slug":"/artist/the-fixx"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
