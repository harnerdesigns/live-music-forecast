Founded by guitarist and band leader Tom Monda, the band self-released an EP in 2011, The Perils of Time Travel, before signing with Coheed and Cambria frontman Claudio Sanchez’s newly launched Evil Ink Records. Their 2012 full length debut, Maps of Non-Existent Places (re-released in 2014), was a critical success, making inroads on the Billboard Hard Rock and Heat-seekers charts, and was eventually named “Album of the Week” by Revolver Magazine in 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thank+You+Scientist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e8d955e6a922a3b90a75f3591fcee36c/3576c331/db9e9724d07594f65cb368d5d9895101d3c9d2d0?ts=1653718493&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4529acfa95f56b67"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Thank You Scientist","today":"2022-05-28T06:15:01.359Z","slug":"/artist/thank-you-scientist"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
