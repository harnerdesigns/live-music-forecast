Sure, the guitar shredder’s talent shimmers with the same resonance as his heroes, but he’s been wielding an axe since he learned to talk – he started playing when he was 2.\n\nKing was born into music, gifted with steel-string DNA and two generations of men before him who nurtured the boy’s musical nature. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Marcus+King+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9e8239997f17da85c296c9263bee0111/dca627f2/ab6761610000e5ebee7b218a21595886d128dac7"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-marcus-king-band-05-06-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-05-07T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":"2022-05-07T01:00:00.000Z","Name":"The Marcus King Band","Subtitle":null,"Description":"A 25-year-old guitar phenom and innovative songwriter, Marcus King can simultaneously switch from swaggering rock to supersonic soul, having written songs and performing onstage for half his lifetime. All five members of the band, drummer Jack Ryan, bass player Stephen Campbell, trumpeter/trombonist Justin Johnson, keyboard player, and sax player Chris Spies, create a blistering, yet soulful unit that has honed their synergy through endless touring. Marcus started learning guitar at age three or four. He has played professionally since he was 11 and always knew he wanted to make music his life. A fourth-generation musician, Marcus has followed in his family footsteps. His grandfather was a country guitarist, and his father continues to perform live. From the start, Marcus earned rave reviews for his kinetic musicianship with The Washington Post describing him as a guitar phenom.","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/13d7c0842acfadb051170b5ed59a085b/5322b8a9/0d6f7c51-d677-4c74-a31f-24ca5cbbfd7e_1546531_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/avalon-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Avalon Theatre","City":null}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"The Marcus King Band","today":"2022-03-03T00:37:39.452Z","slug":"/artist/the-marcus-king-band"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
