Their début was the double A-side 12\" Hey Mami / Play It Right (16 Jul 2013), featuring a capella and instrumental versions of each song.\n\nMeath’s powerful voice is front and center, unjoined by fellow harmonizers as it is in her folk group, Mountain Man. Sanborn, who plays bass in the genre-destroying Megafaun, creates intricate, pulsing grooves for Meath’s voice to inhabit.\n\nSites: SoundCloud, Deezer, Discogs and BandCamp <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sylvan+Esso\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Electropop","Indie Pop","Etherpop"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Electropop"}},{"data":{"Name":"Indie Pop"}},{"data":{"Name":"Etherpop"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8fff1278b104dec33fb6429e9397abf2/f7f6d28b/ab6761610000e5ebc150de235bbd28aafa52e318"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Sylvan Esso","today":"2021-10-25T18:22:06.678Z","slug":"/artist/sylvan-esso"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
