Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Jarrenâ€™s story is different from your average trapper/hustler down south rapper. With sick humorous punch lines and heart felt tales of personal struggle, Jarren gives you that balance of hardcore and conscious rap music. No fake dope boy gimmicks or gritty tales of being shot 100 times; Jarren gives you a 100% him. His cocky attitude can sometimes be mistaken as arrogance but he knows he is the best. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jarren+Benton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d6d383dc94e4552024081fce8990161c/93cc6833/ab6761610000e5ebd07a3fb4a2c4022b5d76b920?ts=1658060360&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=fecaedd755172304"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Jarren Benton","today":"2022-07-17T12:19:30.317Z","slug":"/artist/jarren-benton"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
