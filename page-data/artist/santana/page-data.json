The band came to public attention with their performance of \"Soul Sacrifice\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. Carlos Santana's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music, though it never lost its Latin influence. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Santana\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/55dd21d17416349569926452b33c9a33/e7affe72/e1bfc98896b3638caa59ef227d52fb1a2208375d?ts=1651061872&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=2f422fa398e5307f"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/santana-earth-wind-fire-miraculous-supernatural-tour-06-29-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-06-30T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Santana + Earth, Wind & Fire: Miraculous Supernatural Tour","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d028da2e9d06b0c2286c822fc790ce49/fd57daef/bb744a1e-1521-4947-9cdf-e0467cb165f0_1300561_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1651061873&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4b7782001b65e421"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ball-arena"},"data":{"Name":"Ball Arena","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Santana","today":"2022-04-27T12:18:02.085Z","slug":"/artist/santana"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
