Initially a recording project for the songs of Chris Ash, the group started playing live shows and gaining attention from students. They ended the year by opening for DePaul University's \"FEST\", a live concert headlined by Ludacris where they opened for Guster. Since then, they have released their debut EP Like the Sun, which chronicles their early growth as a band and provides a glimpse into the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Holdfast\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/38e657544f5642ca46bc9a36bf04b85a/6bf63df9/ab67616d0000b2737692c3af40a861238d349057"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/holdfast-w-compass-cavern-my-body-sings-electric-12-02-2021"},"data":{"StartDate":"2021-12-03T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Holdfast. w/ Compass & Cavern + My Body Sings Electric","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/253e701cfe63236cb3224a75cc4a181a/d706d572/get"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/larimer-lounge"},"data":{"Name":"Larimer Lounge","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Holdfast","today":"2021-12-03T00:50:16.305Z","slug":"/artist/holdfast"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
