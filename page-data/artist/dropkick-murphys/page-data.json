First playing together in the basement of a friend's barbershop, the band made a name for itself because of its relentless touring and for its annual St. Patrick's Day weekend shows in Boston. The band's songs often deal with Celtic influences, and the working-class environment in which the band members grew up.\n\nThe band put out a series of EPs and was signed by Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong's label Hellcat Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dropkick+Murphys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Celtic Rock","Boston Rock"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Celtic Rock"}},{"data":{"Name":"Boston Rock"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b980f60f45f6c8fff0a9fd3cb76ad6bb/40adb469/ab6761610000e5eb2b3032f701dee12a10157f83"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Dropkick Murphys","today":"2021-10-27T11:54:23.520Z","slug":"/artist/dropkick-murphys"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
