The band has evolved over the years, growing from 3 to 5 members and describe their sound as \"their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll\".\n\nThe band was formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), who initially played together at an open mic night. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f73f49419e89018713a8835d9e48f937/a66bf64d/ab6761610000e5eb24debcb38288279852ae5431?ts=1654236887&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=01d1e59b4a3784a5"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Greensky Bluegrass","today":"2022-06-03T06:14:56.117Z","slug":"/artist/greensky-bluegrass"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
