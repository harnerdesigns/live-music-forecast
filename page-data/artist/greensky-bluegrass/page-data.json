The band has evolved over the years, growing from 3 to 5 members and describe their sound as \"their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll\".\n\nThe band was formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), who initially played together at an open mic night. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f73f49419e89018713a8835d9e48f937/a66bf64d/ab6761610000e5eb24debcb38288279852ae5431?ts=1657801343&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=8f8e0e08825ea5bd"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/greensky-bluegrass-09-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-15T00:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Greensky Bluegrass","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5dbbe7a2349f467b309919ae0f6d290d/39683257/5231550d-1cfc-43f8-9555-807ceecbc2ab_1545361_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657801342&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4786b55eb4a4deba"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/dillon-amphitheater"},"data":{"Name":"Dillon Amphitheater","City":"Dillon"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Greensky Bluegrass","today":"2022-07-14T12:22:34.104Z","slug":"/artist/greensky-bluegrass"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
