The band has evolved over the years, growing from 3 to 5 members and describe their sound as \"their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll\".\n\nThe band was formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), who initially played together at an open mic night. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Jamgrass","Bluegrass","New Americana","Midwest Americana","Progressive Bluegrass"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Jamgrass"}},{"data":{"Name":"Bluegrass"}},{"data":{"Name":"New Americana"}},{"data":{"Name":"Midwest Americana"}},{"data":{"Name":"Progressive Bluegrass"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cf6a766ae5452bb34c4792f2a66f1442/e05d9e5d/ab6761610000e5eb446229ec605d2d5efe71422e"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Greensky Bluegrass","today":"2021-10-26T21:32:39.230Z","slug":"/artist/greensky-bluegrass"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
