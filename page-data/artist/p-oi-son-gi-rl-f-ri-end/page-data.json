She has been recording and performing as Poison Girl Friend since 1989, and released several albums in the 1990s. She also records as half of equally-undocumented duo Kiss-o-Matic. She likes cheese, olives and curry and sometimes works as an ambient/jungle DJ to keep the pantry stocked. She seems equally happy with the spelling \"Poison Girlfriend\", so nuts to your tags. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/POiSON+GiRL+FRiEND\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8b83976af94e822796964300e64a9f3c/7ef9e8ee/ab67616d0000b273f78bb04e337eb2cb5e249cb4"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"POiSON GiRL FRiEND","today":"2021-10-27T17:37:15.980Z","slug":"/artist/p-oi-son-gi-rl-f-ri-end"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
