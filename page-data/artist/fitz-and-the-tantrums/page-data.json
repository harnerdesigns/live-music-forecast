The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e61619d4463d05e4cc10ae54d444661b/f43e68c7/ab6761610000e5eb7ef3783488fcf0dab0708970?ts=1657995256&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cf3c1945a44b278e"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/fitz-and-the-tantrums-08-17-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-18T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Fitz and the Tantrums","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e271ba43aa0cd46a7cefad68a76b8a2a/649aaa38/54c51b0f-b972-4a1b-b68e-8224cbc68edc_1665711_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1657995255&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=151bf0bc294135b1"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gerald-ford-amphitheatre"},"data":{"Name":"Gerald Ford Amphitheatre","City":"Vail"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Fitz and The Tantrums","today":"2022-07-16T18:14:25.270Z","slug":"/artist/fitz-and-the-tantrums"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
