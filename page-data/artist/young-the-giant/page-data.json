The band consists of Sameer Gadhia (vocals, percussion), Jacob Tilley (guitar), Eric Cannata (guitar), Payam Doostzadeh (bass) and Fran√ßois Comtois (drums). The band's name is purposefully nonsensical; Gadhia explained it as a \"leftfield idea\" meant to evoke curiosity.\n\nThe band released their debut self-titled album, Young the Giant, on 25 January 2011, which was preceded by a digital-only release in October 2010. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Young+the+Giant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Rock"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Rock"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/923b2a2bcf60593c9efd59e209cc4a8e/5c4c6955/ab6761610000e5eb845e18be4bffbae6886e8d41"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Young the Giant","today":"2021-10-26T08:23:15.355Z","slug":"/artist/young-the-giant"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
