Their 2009 album \"Glass Half\" (Piecemeal Records) is unmistakably Californian, with a touch of roots, alt-country, folk-rock, and late 60's British Invasion, but while their sound is at once familiar, it's surprisingly tough to pin down.  Great music for driving with the windows wide open, top down, and volume up.\n\nwww.jumbleband.com\n\n2) DJ dance electronica/house drumbeats\n\n3) JUMBLE is a Japanese pop punk band from Japan.\nhttps://twitter.com/Jumble63783052 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jumble\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ea96b7520dde70689bef7ae560e27be5/582efe32/ab6761610000e5ebaf5f66229792c6a95275c386"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Jumblekye","today":"2021-10-26T18:22:34.255Z","slug":"/artist/jumblekye"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
