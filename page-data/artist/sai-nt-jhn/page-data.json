This is stupid. My name is SAINt JHN, that's my real name, it's spelled a little different tho. I'm from Brooklyn, I spent half of my childhood growing up in Georgetown, Guyana. I was dirt poor in Brooklyn and some version of rich in Guyana, because apparently 2 nickles can buy you a sports car in a 3rd world country. Who knew?! I'm from a SUPER Christian household where my mom forced us to go to every church imaginable, EVERY, SINGLE, WEEK! I hated it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/SAINt+JHN\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":["Pop Rap","Melodic Rap"],"GenresRec":[{"data":{"Name":"Pop Rap"}},{"data":{"Name":"Melodic Rap"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3a7498987b1f2dcc66e438b720205c95/ae883d8c/ab6761610000e5eb26440e0d39e887915c308778"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"SAINt JHN","today":"2021-10-26T22:54:10.111Z","slug":"/artist/sai-nt-jhn"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
