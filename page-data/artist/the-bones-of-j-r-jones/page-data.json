Jones is a project from American singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jonathon Linaberry (born in central New York State in 1982).\n\nJ.R. is said to have started dabbling in music when he was six and his mother mandated – as she did with his older and younger brothers – that he take piano lessons. A self-taught guitar and banjo player, J.R.’s fondness for old gospel hymns, bluesmen like Son House and R.L. Burnside, and artists like The Carter Family and Tom Waits <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bones+of+J.R.+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f83323542d7b1a6d46751cae4f9c762e/2c6bd79d/ab6761610000e5eb045d5ca9454b3e254e1d8728?ts=1657908934&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=5cdb62b62abdbb00"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":2,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/the-bones-of-j-r-jones-07-22-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-23T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"The Bones of J.R.

Its a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012s The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether its a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above.
