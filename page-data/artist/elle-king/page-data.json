She often draws comparisons to Billie Holiday, Duffy, Regina Spektor and Adele. Miss King cites old blues, rock n' roll, and greats like Johnny Cash as her biggest influences.\n\nFeatured in an issue of Love magazine and February's V Magazine as well as creating buzz amongst music bloggers everywhere. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elle+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2cd4f9a43332a43e1ef8423956f216a4/d029ce22/ab6761610000e5eb1a99a24668784470f4256d1b"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/elle-king-03-18-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-03-19T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Elle King","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0cd029e47e39002d627a6701b61532ae/655f6e07/f2ced72c-4e7f-450f-afbf-3454977cc3b2_1546571_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gothic-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Gothic Theatre","City":"Englewood"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Elle King","today":"2022-03-05T18:11:43.895Z","slug":"/artist/elle-king"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
