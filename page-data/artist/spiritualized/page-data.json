Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.\n\nThe first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b4456abeae7059e3facb9e6eec501a3b/9cca03e1/ab6761610000e5ebff76ffdcaf85d06eadaf0667"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/spiritualized-04-04-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-04-05T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Spiritualized","Subtitle":null,"Description":null,"Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/29246b39db18676611df726bbae0ecd2/669abcc5/f5217f9a-ad88-4d90-b76b-c173c18c90cb_1591541_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ogden-theatre"},"data":{"Name":"Ogden Theatre","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Spiritualized","today":"2022-03-12T18:11:49.607Z","slug":"/artist/spiritualized"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
