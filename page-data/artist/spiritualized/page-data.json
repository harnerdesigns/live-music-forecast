Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.\n\nThe first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b4456abeae7059e3facb9e6eec501a3b/9cca03e1/ab6761610000e5ebff76ffdcaf85d06eadaf0667?ts=1656008082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=cb880a401988dca4"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":0,"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Spiritualized","today":"2022-06-23T18:14:51.151Z","slug":"/artist/spiritualized"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
