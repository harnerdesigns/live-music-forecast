Lifting the brash and rugged energy of bass music off the dance floors and the power of metal and hard rock from the stadiums, Sullivan King creates a musical mosh pit built entirely on rapid-paced, neck-snapping dubstep, intensely shredding guitars and a bold live show that pushes the boundaries of modern music performance. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sullivan+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","Twitter":null,"Instagram":null,"Facebook":null,"Soundcloud":null,"Genres":null,"GenresRec":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/54baf75f16f5c091640a24ab6cb65506/9b70d2f4/ab6761610000e5ebf856fe2812a4cd7cbec59ce8"}]}},"events":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/sullivan-king-02-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-02-12T04:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Sullivan King","Subtitle":"LAYZ","Description":"<p class=\"normal\" align=\"center\"><em>&ldquo;If DJs are today&rsquo;s rock stars, then Sullivan King is forging his own rock galaxy</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\" align=\"center\"><strong>- <em>LA Weekly</em></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><strong>Sullivan King,</strong> the one-half metal, one-half bass music artistic creation of <strong>Keaton</strong> <strong>Prescott</strong>, will embark on an international tour through the end of&nbsp; 2019 and into early 2020. The tour will include performances at <strong>Electric Zoo, Lost Lands,</strong> and <strong>Imagine</strong> <strong>Festival</strong>, as well as stops in Australia, China, and New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Since beginning his touring musical career in 2017 with a bus tour as support for the Electronic Rock group I See Stars (Sumerian Records), and most recently supporting Excision on his latest arena rocking Apex Tour in 2019, Sullivan King has proved he has the sonic charisma and crowd-controlling stage presence to erase the genre lines that most artists remain solitarily confined.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\"><em>&ldquo;I just created the music I wanted to hear in the world,&rdquo; </em>says Sullivan King.<em> Bass music, but with loud guitars, massive drums, screaming vocals. I wanted to do something that people weren&rsquo;t doing, even if I had to learn it myself. It&rsquo;s worth trying something new and pushing the sounds of both worlds forward and if I didn&rsquo;t either someone else would, or no one was going to.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">With<strong> </strong>collaborations with Bass music's greatest heavyweights and support from Billboard #1&rsquo;s like <strong>The</strong> <strong>Chainsmokers</strong>,<strong> DJ</strong> <strong>Snake</strong>, and <strong>Marshmello</strong>, Sullivan King, by unanimous decision, is an artist with the power to turn heads, drop jaws, and raise horns to the sky. In two years as an act, and hundreds of shows already behind him, there is no doubt that his upcoming 2019 headline world tour is going to be nothing less than explosive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"BodyA\">With this massive tour and new music on the horizon, Sullivan King is ready to usher in a brand new chapter in his already storied career.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\"><em><br /></em></p>","Tags":null,"Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/dab1d89c2d89ac3a76e04427f7fbd387/9d565179/sullivan-king-tickets_02-11-22_18_6116df7245e39.jpg"}],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"Name":"Mission Ballroom","City":"Denver"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"artist":"Sullivan King","today":"2022-01-21T18:18:56.604Z","slug":"/artist/sullivan-king"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
