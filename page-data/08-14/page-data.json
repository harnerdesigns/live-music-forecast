Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based bands affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPRs Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendozas artistic voice like never before. Soy como soy, Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold even political statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bambas most unbridled offering yet.Mujeres was recorded by Luz Elena Mendoza and Ryan Oxford at Color Therapy Studios and Besitos Fritos Studios in Portland, Oregon. Mixed by Jeff Bond, with Grace Bugbee on bass, John Niekrasz on drums, Margaret Wher Gibson on keys, and Ed Rodriguez and Ryan Oxford on electric guitar.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657174554&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6066258852e2a430"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/said-the-sky-08-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Said The Sky","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/said-the-sky"},"data":{"Name":"Said The Sky"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0acf54d9712b4ee5299dffbaf57c6953/8261bbcf/0684c910-7c37-455d-bc83-273362cb8dae_1582471_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1657174553&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=966767da7b78985d"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Red Rocks Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/red-rocks-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Red Rocks Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/amos-lee-08-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-15T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Amos Lee","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/amos-lee"},"data":{"Name":"Amos Lee"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2330085b87bcc369bd1d0e166c0e2f76/12f1c7d2/d28f31b1-8842-4908-8b7e-792d33132053_1517761_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1657174554&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=3c2e1ec6465d8e2f"}],"Venue_City":["Vail"],"Venue_Name":["Gerald Ford Amphitheatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/gerald-ford-amphitheatre"},"data":{"City":"Vail","Name":"Gerald Ford Amphitheatre"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/collective-soul-08-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-15T01:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Collective Soul","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/collective-soul"},"data":{"Name":"Collective Soul"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f823e97da0ccdff8c6a53451be81e06e/4c2c3822/0b977006-3c25-4c96-8473-7b5a0b9e4a2d_1645031_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1657174554&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=769be36310cde06c"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Mission Ballroom"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/mission-ballroom"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Mission Ballroom"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/bombino-08-14-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-15T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Bombino","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-14-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/bombino"},"data":{"Name":"Bombino"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/41ba5029ef743387a203981c7f45d983/c75395d3/4053ceaf-d325-4c06-9c03-1d49077974e0_927721_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657174553&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=f52f104fe5be4713"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Boulder Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/boulder-theatre"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Boulder Theatre"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"08-14-2022","today":"2022-07-07T06:16:08.865Z","slug":"08-14"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
