All five members of the band, drummer Jack Ryan, bass player Stephen Campbell, trumpeter/trombonist Justin Johnson, keyboard player, and sax player Chris Spies, create a blistering, yet soulful unit that has honed their synergy through endless touring. Marcus started learning guitar at age three or four. He has played professionally since he was 11 and always knew he wanted to make music his life. A fourth-generation musician, Marcus has followed in his family footsteps. His grandfather was a country guitarist, and his father continues to perform live. From the start, Marcus earned rave reviews for his kinetic musicianship with The Washington Post describing him as a guitar phenom.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"05-06-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/the-marcus-king-band"},"data":{"Name":"The Marcus King Band"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/13d7c0842acfadb051170b5ed59a085b/5322b8a9/0d6f7c51-d677-4c74-a31f-24ca5cbbfd7e_1546531_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Avalon Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/avalon-theatre"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Avalon Theatre"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"05-06-2022","today":"2022-02-18T18:11:43.308Z","slug":"05-06"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
