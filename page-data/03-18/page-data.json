If you would like to experience the converged worlds during your visit, exhibit tickets can be purchased separately and are based on availability. \n\nResting confidently within layers of synthesizers and demonstrative drums, Denver, Colorado based 888’s Critical Mistakes EP and “Everybody Can’t Complain” their latest full length album, rests a poignant and recurring message- “Don’t give up.” Throughout the course of the infectious Alternative-Electro sounding songs, road-tested frontman Danny Stillman repeatedly reaffirmed the significance and impact of staying the course. Regardless of life’s accomplishments and catastrophes, the band, rounded out by (drummer) Danny Cooper, definitely accentuate the importance of continuing on. Critical Mistakes EP opening track and lead single “Critical Mistakes” professes “Come wake me up before I die and never get to live,” before adding “let the tide wash away my critical mistakes”. Unwilling to rest easy, 888 is consistently pushing forward and actively reaching for more.\n  \nThe duo won KTCL’s 2015 “Hometown For The Holidays” competition in both fan voting and live performance categories, cementing their place in Denver’s burgeoning music scene and garnering the attention of radio stations all across the country. 888 has since headlined Alt Nation’s Advanced Placement Tour, opened for Andrew McMahon, The Rocket Summer, and secured festival appearances at summer staples like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Bottlerock, ACL, Hangout Music Festival and more.
