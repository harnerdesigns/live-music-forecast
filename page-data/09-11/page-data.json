Every Tuesday night, the five-piece group came together via Zoom from theirrespective homesfrom L.A. to Asheville-to host theGood Time Supper Club, a ninety-minutevariety program.It was nice to be able to use music as a connective thread and something thats healing, says guitarist-vocalist Ed Jurdi. We were doing itfor ourselves, but the greatest benefit was how it created thiscommunity for us to hang out with our fans.Guitarist-vocalist and fellow founding member Gordy Quist agrees. The show was like a release,where we all connected and forgot about the stuffgoing on around us. At some point, we decided tobring in guests for an interview, and that turned into Hey, lets pre-record a music video of a cover songwith each of them.That segment of the show, calledRemote Transmissions, became a much-anticipated fan favorite eachweek. And it is now the title of their latest album, featuring covers of ten classic songs with guestvocals by the likes of Margo Price, Ray Wylie Hubbard and Charlie Starr.Its just the latest innovative move for The Band Of Heathens, who over the last fifteen years havereleased nine acclaimed albums of roots rock originals, played festivals like Bonnaroo and South bySouthwest, and toured the world many times over (Rolling Stonecalls them a smoking live band), allwhile remaining that rarest of birdsa truly independent group","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"09-11-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c2fffd0ccb33f16948d404eab5016c94/22b68ccc/5152f628-8b52-4bf0-833d-89075f70fbe0_284001_RETINA_PORTRAIT_16_9.jpg?ts=1658751892&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=f74fa64739651bdf"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/american-full-moon-30-years-of-moonspell-09-11-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-09-12T00:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"American Full Moon: 30 Years of Moonspell","Description":"Doors 6:30 PM Show 7:30 PM THIS SHOW IS ALL AGES All support acts and times subject to change Based on the latest local guidelines, attendees are no longer required to provide proof of negative COVID-19 test AND/OR vaccination for entry into this event.
