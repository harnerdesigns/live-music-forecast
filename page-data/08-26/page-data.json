Still promoting his first full-length album, Livers and Diers, Yancey has laid the foundation for a long career as a songwriter. Jesh began playing and writing music in 2002 and has been crafting his sound ever since. After failing out of college the first time and running off to join the Navy, Yancey found himself on the Gulf Coast with a pen in his hand and something to say where the majority of the songs for Livers and Diers emerged. With influences like John Prine, Guy Clark, Todd Snider and Widespread Panic, Jesh has established a catalogue of songs with a solid groove and an honest sentiment that takes a couple listens to fully take in. Livers and Diers is a journey from the darkest depths of ignorance to the blinding truths of everyday life and is an attempt to jolt the listener into deeper thought while their toe starts tapping. Jesh grew up in rural northeast Alabama and was raised by a cowboy and an English teacher which is where he found his way with words and a working-mans point of view that contributes to his fearless, gritty, no-frills style. Yancey pens songs that highlight the challenges in society while leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions. Jesh found The High Hopes in the fall of 2018 in Mobile, Alabama and theyve been playing everywhere that will have them ever since. The High Hopes have had several lineup changes since Yancey moved from Mobile but the foundation is still firmly rooted in a type of American Music Yancey refers to as PsycheDeltaFolk that allow Jesh to carry the listener through each song in any direction. One set might consist of heady jams while the next set grooves the country blues all while being original music. Jesh and his wife, Miranda, moved to the city of Denver, Colorado in July 2019 to establish roots in the rich Colorado music scene. Catch Jesh hustlin through the city lookin for a gig and something that rhymes!","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-26-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7ad8db1612345d42d2d8f56cf9e8d7d3/a4f3ad69/c58dd0af-cda8-49b2-bdaf-068540c3a677_106541_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657369082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=8f8ee17ee843fc23"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/the-black-buzzard-at-oskar-blues"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"The Black Buzzard at Oskar Blues"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/gimme-gimme-disco-08-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Gimme Gimme Disco","Description":"DOORS: 8:00 PM SHOW: 8:00 PM THIS SHOW IS: 21 AND OVER","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-26-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f7f0e2d080b756ce97377b8611fb702a/edc446c0/774748cd-480c-4a84-8547-b28ab48ca2b7_1240671_RECOMENDATION_16_9.jpg?ts=1657369082&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=7dd275aa1af1f6a5"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Summit"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/summit"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Summit"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/amanda-miguel-ana-victoria-verdaguer-siempre-te-amare-08-26-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-08-27T02:30:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Amanda Miguel & Ana Victoria Verdaguer: SIEMPRE TE AMARE","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"08-26-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b38d32ef5e2156f513d9fb1196d99d5d/5bf6de52/5fefbd1c-973b-4b0e-9b2e-d78e4ce37548_106111_RETINA_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657369081&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=1b2a5dcbce6b8d7b"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Paramount Theatre"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/paramount-theatre"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Paramount Theatre"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"08-26-2022","today":"2022-07-09T12:18:12.912Z","slug":"08-26"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
