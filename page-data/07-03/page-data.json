The Altons, natives of the region, combine dust kicked up from backyard parties with evening Art Laboe listening sessions, evoking a sound that veers far from the shadows. The Altons curate a ballad of retro-indie-soul that has captivated local audiences for several years, quickly driving them to become a staple of the scene. Their distinct sound caught the attention of Daptone Records Co-founder Gabe Roth, who was in the process of starting Penrose Records. Penrose became a subsidiary label to Daptone to highlight the emerging soul-scene growing in Southern California, where The Altons fit perfectly.Their Penrose debut When You Go (Thats When Youll Know) was KCRWs Todays Top Tune, and their most recent single Tangled Up In You has been featured on Soulection Radio.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/02dbacd115c6064199bed385427b349c/e45448bc/2352e3b5-8496-496b-97a3-e605177e848b_105851_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=d3b0df486df7489f"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/gates-to-hell-blind-to-life-pressure-drop-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-04T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Gates to Hell, Blind to Life, Pressure Drop","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/pressure-drop"},"data":{"Name":"Pressure Drop"}},{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/blind-to-life"},"data":{"Name":"Blind To Life"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/17017193b7100dab12bc4d31c7f535c2/0da7daaf/99_Edp.jpg?ts=1656526750&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=6637765bcbe350e1"}],"Venue_City":null,"Venue_Name":["Vultures"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/vultures"},"data":{"City":null,"Name":"Vultures"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/liily-catcher-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-04T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Liily, Catcher","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/05936b6129c66ccca5b99f791c2b7095/04b9eb82/c616f8a2-c74b-40b7-b532-546e27518d5b_1619591_CUSTOM.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=ee5ff371e4d1211a"}],"Venue_City":["Colorado Springs"],"Venue_Name":["Black Sheep"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/black-sheep"},"data":{"City":"Colorado Springs","Name":"Black Sheep"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/chris-stapletons-all-american-road-show-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-04T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Chris Stapleton's All American Road Show","Description":"Originally scheduled forJune 26, 2022 7:00 PM Previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new date.","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/96325cf67eb11116fd996b7179d5e8a9/76c5663a/de44f735-7be1-41f8-81b8-60ff37181754_1283701_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1656526748&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=8f8bfdddb8324856"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Ball Arena"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/ball-arena"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Ball Arena"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/cole-swindell-w-lainey-wilson-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-04T02:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Cole Swindell w/ Lainey Wilson","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":[{"fields":{"slug":"/artist/cole-swindell"},"data":{"Name":"Cole Swindell"}}],"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a19aa1db6934ed88c785c7b3f818ad84/eec33160/3e4143a2-d0f4-4fe3-a65b-791958729c0c_1197921_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=fc34f85f124ec7b6"}],"Venue_City":["Greeley"],"Venue_Name":["Greeley Stampede"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/greeley-stampede"},"data":{"City":"Greeley","Name":"Greeley Stampede"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/rockumbiando-07-03-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-04T03:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Rockumbiando","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-03-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9cb40a95af663349515c6b234e10bf4/70067dd5/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1656526749&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=4215c261dc40f6b7"}],"Venue_City":["Aurora"],"Venue_Name":["Stampede"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/stampede"},"data":{"City":"Aurora","Name":"Stampede"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"day":"07-03-2022","today":"2022-06-29T18:19:26.460Z","slug":"07-03"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
