Just in time to celebrate our 25th birthday. The band had just released its 12th studio album in January 2020. The Unraveling was mostly recorded in Memphis at Sam Phillips Recording Service nine new songs detailing the horrific state of MAGA America in songs that addressed white supremacy, school shootings and the opioid crisis. The album earned excellent reviews (including later being named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone in France) and we set out on the road playing shows up the east coast including NYC, Boston and DC. Unfortunately, the pandemic happened and we only completed one three-week leg of what was supposed to be a 15-month tour. In lockdown, we all did what we could. Cooley, Jay and I played numerous virtual shows from our respective homes. Matt Patton built up his already successful studio (Dial Back Sound in Water Valley, MS) and album productions including acclaimed records from Bette Smith and Jimbo Mathus. Jay Gonzalez released his third excellent solo album Back to the Hive.Turn it up loud and see you at the Rock and Roll Show,Patterson Hood","SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-15-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e6f12b45ca7298531b4737a92526f2a3/4b1239a1/8be3d654-e6e9-411a-9d78-f5e966e012ea_1590991_RETINA_PORTRAIT_3_2.jpg?ts=1657801343&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=e0b54addc6c1e3d2"}],"Venue_City":["Denver"],"Venue_Name":["Levitt Pavilion Denver"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/levitt-pavilion-denver"},"data":{"City":"Denver","Name":"Levitt Pavilion Denver"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/lava-gato-lungburn-ovira-violence-in-violent-07-15-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-16T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Lava Gato, Lungburn, Ovira, Violence In Violent","Description":null,"SoldOut":null,"Tags":null,"Day":"07-15-2022","Featured":null,"Artist_Genres":null,"Artists":null,"Image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4d5eb1094170ed3c783f1c4c1b7b9221/8c55bbac/b293c0ad-c904-4215-bc59-8d7f2414dfbc_106141_EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_16_9.jpg?ts=1657801341&userId=usr6NqVXGs7Gt4dhJ&cs=22c4c2867a6ecb77"}],"Venue_City":["Colorado Springs"],"Venue_Name":["Black Sheep"],"Venues":[{"fields":{"slug":"/venues/black-sheep"},"data":{"City":"Colorado Springs","Name":"Black Sheep"}}]}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/event/uprooted-ft-michael-glabicki-of-rusted-root-07-15-2022"},"data":{"StartDate":"2022-07-16T01:00:00.000Z","EndDate":null,"DoorsTime":null,"Name":"Uprooted ft.

Its a modern sound steeped in the golden age of 90s country, a decade whose southern storytelling and larger-than-life hooks left a permanent part on the young songwriter.That sound is whittled to a razor-edged point with 2021s self titled LP Triston Marez. Produced by David Dorn and Alex Torrez, the album strikes a balance between youthful enthusiasm and focused maturity. Marez co-wrote nine of the albums twelve tracks, with modern-day legends like Chris Stapleton penning the remaining songs. Another legend 90s country kingpin Ronnie Dunn appears on Where the Neon Lies, turning the song not only into a show-stopping duet, but also a nod to the next generation of melodic, story-driven country stars. Triston Marez may be making contemporary music, but hes doing so with the influence and the support of the icons who came before him, singing songs like Day Drinking and the Tejano-influenced Texas Swing cowritten with Americana Critics Favorite Gabe Lee (featuring the Tex-Mex band Squeezebox Bandits) with an ease that belies his young years. Laced with Telecaster twang, swooning pedal steel, dancehall ballads, and honky-tonk anthems, Triston Marez is a battle cry from an artist who bridges the gap between modern country and the genres old-school classics.
